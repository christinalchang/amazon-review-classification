B000PKKAGO,,5,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.","12 11, 2007",A28N2AWOVO2PB,Simon Cleveland,,End of all irritation,1197331200,False,,All_Beauty

B000GLRREU,,5,"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way. My teeth feel super clean even 12  hours after using this wonderful machine.

B01E7UKR38,,5,"I don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

Additionally, the box does caution the user that this product has been known to NOT last the full month ... something to consider as you weigh Sensodyne against this box (of six strips).

B00EYZY6LQ,,5,"This Fekkai conditioning mousse impressed.

It is very lightly scented just as promiseda bit of fruit botanicals and mint.  Fragrance is not noticeable after hair is dried and styled.

 I used it with varying shampoos, one of which was a Fekkai and it worked well with all of them.

I used it with additional styling products and without (just the conditioning mousse).

I used it with a large Spornette brush and a smaller Conair brush.

It worked well no matter the alternatives I used.

My hair feels full and looks full and lightweight.  It holds that fullness without any heaviness throughout the day.

My hair felt conditioned.

Upon arising the next morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my hair still looked full and light with just a tiny bit of finger fluffing.

It is an additional boost to have the conditioner and mousse in one application and worth its cost.

Note that during applicationshake the can well, then and use a light pressure on the nozzle.  A dollop seems to grow in size as you finger it through your washed hair.

Last thing I'll mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.

My biggest issues with conditioner is that I use WAY too much. I don't really mean to, it just comes flying out of the bottle into my hand. I waste a lot of it. That doesn't happen with this aerosol foam formula. I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out. Awesome. This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly. It doesn't feel heavy and thick like some other conditioners.

The conditioner itself smells amazing. It leaves a nice citrus aroma in your hair. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day. After about an hour or so, I can no longer smell it. It does leave my hair feeling amazing. I didn't notice a huge volume improvement, but my hair is pretty thick to begin with. It did help with my frizz and my tangles. After using this conditioner, the brush runs through my hair very easily.

B00W259T7G,,5,"Pr de Provence is known for the large blocks of savon de Marseille made with olive oil that are especially suited for use in the kitchen, but these newer artisanal bars are easier to handle.  They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.  The milk, coconut, and green tea are more subdued fragrances and are a good choice for people who don't like strong fragrances.  They are all made with mostly natural ingredients, and some even have visible bits of almond, pomegranate, sage, etc.","09 7, 2017",A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,Margaret P.,"{'Size:': ' 250 Gram', 'Color:': ' Verbena'}",Natural fragrances,1504742400,False,,All_Beauty

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

Alcohol mouthwash can actually cause the mouth to dry out and breath to be bad faster. I read the label, and saw a warning about possible staining.

While any real faults in any of my experiments are probably due to the recipe itself, this ingredient has reacted as expected and I got to say I've had some great results.  When using this soap on its own, I've been impressed as well.  The almond aroma is not overwhelming, but clean and natural.

B00DY59MB6,,3,"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.

So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.","04 7, 2013",A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,Margaret P.,{'Size:': ' 16.9 Ounce'},"Mild minty flavor, alcohol-free",1365292800,False,3,All_Beauty

B000PKKAGO,,4,"I am reviewing this on behalf of my boyfriend who is the lucky user of this electric shaver. He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.

B0014CN8Y8,,5,"This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System

Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.

I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!

I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!

Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.

The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!

- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.

- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.

- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.

- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.

NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.

- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.

- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!","12 21, 2016",A3VYM3NY7W4MX4,MarkS,,5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","03 2, 2011",A21TPY9BVC9IKZ,Ann,,Eats Lint,1299024000,True,"1,913",Appliances

Pros:
* Works great to clean out lint - almost ""fun"" to use and see the lint come out
* Comes with a short & helpful DVD (English & French)
* I almost gave it 5 stars but because of the cons I think 4 stars is more appropriate

Cons:
* *** BE CAREFUL *** Have to be careful not to purposely or *accidentally* put the drill into reverse or the brush head will detach/unscrew
* *** BE CAREFUL *** Set your drill clutch to no more than half of the maximum setting or the rods may break from too much torque
* I wonder about the possibility of a rod breaking or brush unscrewing... I wonder how tough this thing is... it seems decent, but I would be more confident if it seemed very well built instead of just ""decent"".

Other:
* See the photos I uploaded. I was surprised how much lint came out.

B0056I99WG,,2,"I got a warehouse deal ""LIKE NEW"" and when I installed it, the coil got hot with the timer switch ""on"" but the dryer wasn't running. So in other words, I turned on the dryer to time dry 30 mins, but didn't start the tumbler yet. When I went back in the laundry room about 30 minutes later, it was incredibly hot in there, so I felt the dryer and it was very hot to the touch. I shut it off, unplugged and proceeded to see what the problem was. I changed the thermostat timer and still did the same. I found a youtube video where the guy says the heater element is grounded out and will stay on. Upon very close inspection to the element (after it cooled off), I notice one of the ceramic pieces that hold a coil was broken off and the coil was touching the casing. I flipped the coil back on the ceramic holder and plugged it back in. It worked! Well, I'm not taking any chances with this thing getting hot like it did the coil slips off the broken holder and grounds out again. This unit is going back, and I guess I know why it was in the ""used"" bin. I don't blame the manufacturer, it's just a broken unit that got re-sold. The next unit I will test BEFORE I install it. That would have saved me from a lot of trouble and potential damage from the heater coil being stuck on.

B0014CN8Y8,,5,"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","11 9, 2016",AMY6O4Z9HINO0,J.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","01 15, 2018",A1WD61B0C3KQZB,Jason W.,,"Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!",1515974400,True,4,Appliances

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Hi Susan,

The manufacturer warranty is void if the unit is purchased by a private seller who does not have our consent to sell our products. This is the same reason why we ask for a copy of your receipt upon requesting warranty claims because if it not from a valid authorized dealer we will not proceed with warranty work. We also list our authorized dealers on our web site for customer use. We stand behind our products, however when an item is purchased from a private seller the purchaser runs the risk of the item being used, open box, refurbished, and or a scratch and dent. Our one year limited manufacturer's warranty is only valid on new items sold by our authorized online dealers. It is unfortunate to see that you are in this situation, however you will need to contact the seller of the item for a replacement or refund.

Have a great day!

Hello Mireya-

I'm sorry but I thought the manufacturer warranty was for the manufacturer, NewAir.  Please explain why the warranty is not valid in this case.  I don't see anywhere in the warranty exclusions that the warranty is not valid if not purchased from an authorized dealer.  In addition, a consumer would never know who ""authorized dealers"" are because if a company is selling your product doesn't that implicitly make them authorized to do so?

I sincerely hope that NewAir will reconsider this position and stand by the integrity of their products.  This ice machine was literally used for four hours before failing and it is, quite frankly egregious that your company is negating a warranty that explicitly states it will repair or replace defective materials or workmanship for up to one year.

Please let me know how I can talk to a dispute department regarding this matter.  I look forward to your response and I will refrain from giving any reviews of your product until this matter is resolved.

Thank you,
Susan Ferguson

Hi Susan,

Unfortunately, the ice maker was not purchased from an authorized dealer. You will need to contact the seller ""Mehadrin"" through Amazon for any existing issues on your unit.

Hello-  I received an AI-100S icemaker in March 2014.  I used it one time and within 4 hours the cooling unit had shut down.  My best estimate is that the pump was still working (the water was getting pumped through) but the cooling mechanism was not.  When I plugged the unit back in to try it a few hours later, the cooling mechanism never turned on.

Since this product is still under warranty, I am hoping to acquire a new unit since this particular one has essentially never been used and is obviously faulty in some capacity.

I have attached the receipt for your reference.  It was purchased as a gift through Amazon Marketplace.  Thanks so much and I look forward to your response.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","12 6, 2016",A25C30G90PKSQA,CP,,good kit with some caveats,1480982400,True,6,Appliances

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

B0014CN8Y8,,5,"I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:

1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.
2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.
3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.
4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.
5. Read #4 again.
6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.
7. Marvel at how much lint came out.
8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.
9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.

When I used the embossing tool, the embossing powder simply was blown away, at least the part that didn't adhere to the ink.  There were those who did not get good results from the embossing powder that I had used.  So my not-so-good results may be from either the ink or the embossing powder.

I do hope that I perfect this skill, so that I will be able to give a professional assessment.

They are also deeper and have a bit more variety than Yaley. I have to be very careful using the Yaley molds as there is not a definitive point at which they are full due to the large curve. These molds do not have that problem, but they do have a more textured surface that makes the pieces come out looking dull. Just painting an extra layer of resin over the surface fixes any dullness though. One thing I find frustrating about reviews is that people often say ""this isn't the best mold I've used"" or some such similar thing, but they don't say which are better or how many others they've tried. So I've compiled a comparison list of all the molds I've tried so far based on the qualities of surface texture/sheen, ease of release, shape variety, depth, and edges:

The white blender does a wonderful job blending colors from vibrant to muted, even after your work has dried.  You can also mix the pens to make your own colors. I tried mixing on a folded piece of vellum, and was able to transfer the colors I had created by mixing the pens to a watercolor sheet and use them.

The shaft and such are metal, however, when I attached the shaft onto the device it became more or less stuck. It also did not fit anywhere near flush. I have to clean it attached to the unit due to this. I do not care to risk destroying the device, yet.

Very good directions out of the box. Maybe took an hour to install and that includes jacking up the rear of my Armada and removing the rear wheels. Once you get them deflated and inserted into the springs the job is a breeze. I placed the fill adapters in my hitch next to my wiring harness and it looks almost factory installed.

I aired them up to 10psi, drove around for a bit and the driver side kept losing pressure. Removed/reinserted the air lines and that seemed to help.

While towing my 7000lb travel trailer, these airbags worked great. Rear had very little sag, whereas without them the rear was resting on the bump stops as my autoleveling suspension has stopped working. For $100, this sure beats the heck out of spending $800-1200 to have my suspension fixed and IMO this works better. I like being able to adjust the airbags on the fly. I reduce the pressure to 5psi when I'm not towing and increase anywhere between 30-50psi depending on what trailer I'm pulling.

Right off the bat it determined that when I turned the air on the voltage dropped to 104 volts, then shutdown. The reason for the low voltage is that I was running the RV on a 12 Gage 40' extension cord. I swapped it out for a 10 Gage 50' and all is well.

For the most part the reviews are good and I like Camco products. I purchased the Tornado, laid all my parts out and drilled my hole as per instructions. One reviewer said it took him fifteen minutes to install the Tornado, he is right. I walked back to the garage to get a tool and stepped on the nozzle and broke it! That morning I emailed Camco explaining the above and asked if I could just purchase just the nozzle. I did not want to wait days for a reply so I sucked it up and bought another Tornado Kit and finished the installation. That afternoon I received a reply from Camco. They explained that they could not sell just the nozzle but would send me one for free! Of course I replied and thanked them for their good customer service etc. I received the replacement nozzle and I decided that I would install a second one at the opposite end of the holding tank. I read to really clean the tank that you do not know how it has been taken care of,  put a bag of ice down the toilet before you travel and it will scrub and break loose things that are dried up and sticking to the tank as you are driving. In addition, the article reported when you are at the camp site, not to have a continuous drain of the black holding tank and to dump when needed to prevent things from sticking and drying up. Upon departure from my camp site I attached my clear 45 degree elbow to my dump end and then my slinky and dumped the waste. Then I attached my separate flushing hose to my Tornado connection and slowly turned on the water. It sounded like twin motors humming. I ran the Tornado three to five minutes and watched all kinds of stuff come out of my black holding tank. If holding tanks can smell good, mine definitely does! If you are deciding to get the Tornado, read all the positive reviews and get the good points from them all and you cannot go wrong.","02 5, 2013",A3H8QNMPSTZNJA,deepsea,{'Style:': ' With Hose'},Dual Tornados!,1360022400,False,2,Automotive

Fortunately it did and the Police came out and gave us two hours of fantastic music.

Just as that grecian urn carried the secrets of Ancient Greece and delivered them into the hands of a young John Keats, this album carries the beauty and poetry of another underclass into our hands.  Most of us have never been homeless and most of us merely watched on TV as other people lost their homes to Katrina.  Mary brings these memories home to us with an unwavering realism that forces us to take notice.  And, she is not merely a study in heartbreak as she also finds the redemption of Thanksgiving in prison and the love within a group of railroad tramps.  Mary reaches straight into the center of her stories and brings back nothing but the heart.","12 9, 2007",A2K11PF074J3MY,C.

B001EO2UKO,,5,"If there's anything I've learned about quality music, you can't judge on its initial listen or two. A good rule of thumb for me has become: If I like your CD instantly, I know I won't for long. If I don't like it when I first hear it, I will probably love it. So I have no review at all to give to Dido's new output. I bought it, I've heard it four times, but trying to say what it means at this point would be like trying to tell you all about winter on the very first day of winter. You just can't know it all based on the first day of the season.
I'm an ardent fan of hers, but just like her last two albums, her lyrics, her songs, the beats, her voice, it all has ways of dropping in on me at odd moments, whether I'm actually listening to it or not; a year later I may find that Safe Trip Home will be an album I can't live without for the rest of my life.
I'm a fan of the Turkish singer Berdan Mardini. I have three of his albums and was convinced that his latest was basically a waste of space. But a funny thing happened over time, and many months later, Berdan's soft voice and strong music made his way back into my car cd player. Now I don't know how I lived a year without it. Dido's safe trip may not make it into overly critical or impatient ears, but I'm sure that she will make a safe trip home to my heart and mind, and she will get there in her own time.","11 23, 2008",A25DLEIXIOPHA8,Desert Sage,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},You don't make it home from space in one second,1227398400,False,7,CDs_and_Vinyl

I took a risk-free proposition and bought one fairly inexpensive from a seller on eBay, like $86/$87, cuz I wanted to see if it was real or a fake, and on eBay, if you get a fake, you get your money back!! When it came, it looked fine, factory sealed, authentic box, the sticker and the back cardboard piece with proper barcode (and saying ""made in the EU"")...BUT when I opened it, the signs of ""bootleg"" came roaring forth. The book, while held-together fine and all the pages with good print and pictures, there was a dark stain on the back of it...dirt or black ink I can't tell, it won't come off.  The discs?? All were included, no missing discs...which is fine, BUT some of the cover artwork was faded and the colour of the labels were wrong.  The ones that shoulda been bright red are instead maroon and the wrong ""Columbia"" font in yellow, not white.  And the BIG giveaway?? Thin flimsy rounded plastic bag inserts in each cardboard CD holder...not that there's anything wrong with plastic bag protectors at all, but they were never in the set in each CD in the first place!!

So yeah, when I fully investigated this set, I saw all red flags and called eBay. explained it all, and demanded by money back & am getting it by the weekend.  Now, this thing looks OK from a distance, plays fine and has good sound, and would be fine with casual CD listeners who are not collectors and who would not care about these little details...BUT to those of us who are?? You can dress up a fake to look authentic, but certain things you can't hide.  The thing is a fake, and like a turd or a pig, you can dress it up to look nice, you can put lipstick on it, but it's still a turd.

NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MUSIC!!  This is a body of work that stands alone (47 discs) and is ever-challenging and things to discover, and deserves to be  in an authentic package, not this.  BUT I am hanging onto it until I get a real one...then I will do a fun side-by-side comparison before I chuck it...if I attempt to sell it, I will be caught, so once I get a new one, this thing will be tossed...the discs...I will use the extra box for tchotchkes...

B00005NQJV,,5,"Michael W Smith has always wanted to record a worship album like this. On the EXODUS project he worked to create a multi-artist collaboration that focused on creating modern worship songs for the church. On his new album, WORSHIP, he is able to actually lead a live worship service that absolutely succeeds in putting the focus on where it's supposed to be: God.
The song line-up is a good one. Newer tracks like ""The Heart Of Worship"" and ""Open the Eyes of My Heart"" are sung right along side classic songs like ""Awesome God"" and ""More Love, More Power."" Smith has led worship at his church for years, and that experience shines through here as he proves to be most adept at taking the spotlight off of himself (and the ""all-star"" cast in the choir) and directing it towards the One who was being sung to. The album flows well and though it's not really a ""modern"" worship album (musically it is more traditional) it's got all the passion and genuine spirit associated with the modern worship movement. The studio tracks included as a bonus are also superb (and Smith writes with his wife, Debbie, on ""Purified,"" for the first time in years), and sit well along side previous Smith classics like ""Agnus Dei"" and ""Great Is the Lord.""
If you're a fan of Michael's you're going to pick this up automatically. Even if you're not, you should give it a listen. It doesn't rock and there's nothing particularly innovative here, but it's a real worship experience that brings you into the presence of God, and that's what it's really all about. WORSHIP is definitely one of the best of a growing number of worship album options.

Half of the tracks are frantic, near punk as Moby screams to a frenzied beat.  The rest of the songs are mellow, relaxed and hypnotic.  The best of these is the Eno-esque, ""A Season In Hell"".  The remake of ""That's When I Reach For My Revolver"" is a great rock and roll number - and the only one like it on the album.  Moby brings out the violin on ""Love Song For My Mom"" (literally) and it's hard to tell if it's synthesized or real.  The best song (IMO) on the album is ""Living"", simply a pleasant song and worth the price of the entire CD.
I could have done without all the pontificating in the liner notes and the pleading message, ""please listen to Animal Rights in its entirety at least once"", however nice a gesture it was.  It's the music that really counts here. Moby seems to have been unsure which direction to take here, but just a few of the songs make it worth the listen.","06 14, 2002",AWPODHOB4GFWL,Martin A Hogan,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Moby Takes A Schizophrenic Shift,1024012800,False,8,CDs_and_Vinyl

The DKM definitely gives you more bang for your buck.  In these days of 99 cents per tune downloads, this CD is 25 songs long with plenty of time to enjoy the concert.

On the other hand, if you really want to ROCK, bring it on.  Favorites:

""Fortunate Son"" this is a cover of the CCR song. You just thought CCR could rock.

""Rocky Road to Dublin"" okay, my favorite cover of this is still on the Chieftains' ""Long Black Veil"" CD--you can tell the Chieftains and the Rolling Stones really did not want that session to end, but this is pretty darn good, too.

""Amazing Grace"" okay, I love about every version of this song I hear.  Here it is, more traditional than most of the songs on this CD, complete with bagpipes and audience participation in the intro.  Wait til you get to the body of the song!

B00CEJ2EKE,,5,"It's time for a new Amon Amarth album, which basically means you're going to get your teeth kicked in, but always with a classy touch of melody.  We know these guys don't change much, and those of us who are fans love them for that.  Why?  Because they've never failed to deliver riffs that sound old but new, familiar but different, similar but not the same.  While some bands tend to get stale over time when they don't evolve, Amon Amarth just keep producing one excellent album after another.  Every time out, they add a couple of new touches, but nothing that changes the essential sound or style of the band.  For Deceiver of the Gods, they got producer Andy Sneap, who, in my opinion, gave them a more crisp and thrashy sound than their other albums.  Besides that, I'm hearing more Gothenburg on this one than Surtur Rising, making more of it sound like old Amon Amarth to me.  I thought they de-emphasized that angle on Twilight of the Thunder God and Surtur, but it's back on several tracks here.

The deluxe edition of this CD also boasts a notable experiment.  The band recorded new original songs for an EP called Under the Influence, but in the styles of Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, and AC/DC.  It could have come out like crap, but these tracks are sticking in my head more than the regular album so far.  They absolutely nailed the core sound of each band, not just musically, but in some cases vocally and even lyrically.  They lyrics, main riff, and chorus of the AC/DC-style song especially replicates the spirit of that band.  I had to Google after I listened to it to see if these were maybe covers of obscure demo songs or something.  These guys have offered just about everything they possibly can on their deluxe editions, so it's cool to see them being innovative and still working to give their fans something extra that actually has value.

B00000630Z,,5,"SOURCE:
Live performance from the opening night of the new Visconti production of ""Anna Bolena"" at La Scala in Milan, April 14,1957.

SOUND:
By current standards, the mono sound is boxy and limited.  By the standards of Callas' recorded live performances, it is well above average.  Voices are generally well-caught in a sort of AM radio-ish way, the orchestra slightly less so.  The audience at La Scala that opening night was unusually quiet for an Italian crowd.  Perhaps they were a little awed by the occasion.  Certainly, they were unfamiliar with the opera.  Their recorded responses are positive, generous and at more or less the appropriate spots.  All that aside, anyone who listens to this ""Anna Bolena"" should do so for the performance, not the sound reproduction.

CAST:
ANNA BOLENA, Queen of England - Maria Callas (soprano)
ENRICO VIII, King of England - Nicola Rossi-Lemeni (bass-baritone)
GIOVANNA SEYMOUR, lady-in-waiting to Queen Anna, king's mistress and next Queen of England - Giulietta Simionato (mezzo-soprano)
PERCY, a nobleman dangerously in love with Anna - Gianni Raimondi (tenor)
SMETON, a young page and musician idiotically in love with Anna - Gabriella Carturan (soprano)
LORD ROCHEFORT, Anna's brother who has a talent for being in the wrong place at the wrong time - Plinio Clabassi (baritone)
LORD HERVEY, a courtier who is acutely aware that his career will not be advanced by being Anna's friend - Luigi Rumbo (baritone)

CONDUCTOR:
Gianandrea Gavazzeni with the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala, Milano.

DOCUMENTATION:
Libretto with English translation. Short history of the opera and brief summary of the plot.

TEXT:
This was the second major production of ""Anna Bolena"" in the modern bel canto revival. There are substantial cuts, from which the role of Percy is the greatest sufferer.  Many reviewers clearly suffer the vapors at the very thought of losing a single bar of the golden legacy.  I am not among their number.  Sometimes, less actually is more.  I have seldom found note-complete performances, especially those with pseudo-bel canto ornamentations created on the spot, to offer a markedly improved artistic experience.  Sometimes, as in the horrifying example of Wagner-length ""complete"" ""Tales of Hoffmann,"" it can be a dismal downer.  In this case, the shortened text of ""Anna Bolena"" works well enough.

""Anna Bolena"" premiered at La Scala on December 26, 1830.  It was the big hit that catapulted the 32-year old composer into the great bel canto triad with Rossini and Bellini.  For all its success, the opera shared in the general collapse of bel canto fortunes and lay dormant until the 1950s.  The post-World War II era saw a revival of the bel canto repertory, largely driven by the presence of Maria Callas and the subsequent development of a group of divas who combined enormous power with extraordinary vocal agility.

(Here in the Twenty-first Century, we find ourselves amid a drought of such divas once again.  Where is the next great Medea, Lucia, Norma or Anna Bolena to be found? Almost certainly not among the troops of Handel specialists who come pouring out of today's academies.)

The libretto of ""Anna Bolena"" rests only lightly on the dreary historical facts.  Anne Boleyn is conceived as a fairly typical bel canto heroine, even to the extent of being granted a short mad scene.  The reputation Henry VIII is completely slagged in librettist Romani's telling of the tale.  The king hasn't a single vestige of honor, generosity or loyalty.  He lacks even the self-awareness that makes Shakespeare's monstrous Richard III so entertainingly charming.

It is a part of the received lore among opera fans that the role of Anna is a voice killer.  Why this should be when Norma, say, and Turandot and Isolde are not, I can't say.  Whatever the dangers, the voice of Callas in 1957 was more than a match for them.  Fans of La Divina quite properly regard this as one of her great triumphs.  Critics, on the other hand, profess to detect the earliest cracks in the noble vocal facade.  Perhaps that is so, but I for one do not choose to ignore the virtues of a performance while searching for its faults.

Callas is better supported by the rest of the cast than is often the case with her live recordings.  Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, with his somewhat wooly voice, was not one of the great singers of the Twentieth Century, but he was a good one, nevertheless.  I saw him in San Francisco a couple of times toward the end of his career.  He was a solid performer who could carry an audience with him.  Simionato was very much an A-list singer and sounds like it here, despite the oddly offhand dismissal to be found in the review published by the Good Grey Gramophone Magazine.  (Years later she described this ""Anna Bolena"" as the highlight of her career.)  Gianni Raimondi sounds fine to me in what remains of the part of Percy, although some would doubtless argue that his is not the proper type of voice for the role.  (The very same argument could be made about Callas herself, despite the too-confident insistence of fans that the remarks of the critic Stendahl about the first Anna, Giudita Pasta, show her to have been something of a Nineteenth Century pre-iteration of Callas.)  The singers in the smaller roles, the orchestra, the chorus and the conducting all uphold the reputation of La Scala.

A famous live performance in decent sound with Callas in full La Divina-mode--five stars, of course!

B0002SPPOQ,,2,"Way way back when I was a kid, the differences between punks and teen idols was obvious. There was, for instance, no mistaking the Dead Boys for the Defranco Family. No one was ever going to confuse Sham 69 and the Bay City Rollers. And while Heartbeat Its a Love Beat or Rock and Roll Love Letter, truth be told, may have been guilty pleasures, no one with even the most rudimentary knowledge of rock would have thought of these sorts of songs as having the significance of Beat on the Brat, Chinese Rocks, or Career Opportunities. I should add that if you don't know these songs, you don't know the first thing about punk. And if you don't, then guitar playing pop bands and/or boy bands with guitars like Bowling For Soup are going to seem like punk. They are going to appear to have the qualities associated with punk, qualities like rebelliousness and an adherence to a DIY philosophy, to innovation and anti-commercialism, etc.

Anyway, perhaps I am digressing. It's just that I've heard this band referred to as ""punk"" and because that word actually means something to me, I object when it is misapplied. Actually, these guys aren't necessarily as bad as I once thought. Some of their tunes are rather catchy. My biggest complaint is the way the vocals sound - very whiny, irritating, and overproduced. But I think, in the final analysis, this is all not very much. There is not much originality here. This band will likely be soon forgotten.","12 22, 2005",A3LJ0OBQU01LCL,Ludwig J.

It's interesting to me that every Yello Album(cd?) seems to have a sonic theme to it. Baby is pretty consistant throughout, yet much different than most of thier other work. It's easy to think of it as a few revisions past the 'one second' album, much of what made that one great is here.

Homage to the Mountain is an instrumental track, and it's just fantastic, so clear, so dynamic - you'd think it was a SACD, or DVD-Audio. It alone would be worth having the CD for...

(I will stipulate that my enjoyment of most yello CD's has come through a decent stereo system at pretty good volumes. This is a CD that will not receive justice if it's played through a boom box (much in the way many sci-fi films would not be as exiting on a 13"" TV vs a big screen))

One of my favorates was always the song Blender partially because of the music and the way the drums kick in, but also because of the downright goofy lyrics. (about a blender salesperson who sells door to door, and the blender also happens to convert in to the worlds most powerfull vacuume cleaner)

Anyhow I suppose I've written enough. Can't go wrong with this one or pretty much any of the CD's starting with 'one second' The first 3 CD's were good too but they had more of a home grown low-fidelity sound to them, so the music on them doesn't shine through like it does on the CD's starting with one second.

It's as if her sudden rise to stardom after appearing on the television reality show Britain's Got Talent was meant to be, if not a dream come true.

Now with the prominence of a top ranked seasoned professional, best-selling albums, and top of the chart success covering five continents in over twenty countries, once again she is destined to sing her way into the hearts of millions. Some may find it ironic knowing it all began with the song I Dreamed a Dream.

Susan Boyle's three earlier albums I Dreamed A Dream, The Gift & Someone To Watch Over Me are all popular, easy listening vocal albums loved by an constantly increasing fan base that spans the globe.

Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From The Stage is the newest album by Susan Boyle, due to be released on November 13, 2012. Her newest release is a compilation of classic songs, and as the album subtitle suggests, are 11 favorite songs performed in the theater and some of the greatest movies ever produced.

One day prior to the release of her new album on November 13, 2012 Susan Boyle appeared on NBC's Today Show Concert Series, and performed the Abba cover song The Winner Takes It All. If you listened to her sing live for the first time it was a beautiful introduction.

For the millions of people who know her story and have listened to the soprano sing, simply discovering the talents of Susan Boyle has been the shared moment of victory uniting us all.

One would have thought that there could be no adequate follow-up to ""Mostly Sondheim"", her revelatory celebration of Stephen Sondheim. But Miss Cook continues to amaze. At 77, her voice is showing a few signs of age - but precious few. It's hard to think of anyone else that's sounded this good at 77. More incredibly, it's hard to think of anyone who sounds this good at any age! Her interpretive gifts continue to deepen, her song introductions and discussions of life in the musical theater world are funnier, wiser and more apt than ever, her voice retains its purity and power, and she is clearly having a ball. The songs here are songs from the ""Golden Age"" of musical theater (the late 1940's to the 1960's).  She was one of the most glittering ornaments of that era, but apart from the ""She Loves Me"" songs and a far too brief snatch of ""Till There Was You"", these are not songs from the shows that made her famous. (There is apparently a send-up of ""Glitter and Be Gay"" in the show that must have worked far better live than on record -it's not on this CD). Instead she has chosen songs that she loves from the shows of that era, some very well known, others less so. Her performances include an upbeat ""It's Not Where You Start"", an ecstatic ""Wonderful Guy"", and a glowing ""Mister Snow"" that is as lovely as her 1973 Carnegie Hall rendition (one of my all-time favorite performances), but even more vulnerable. The ""She Loves Me"" quartet is marvelously sung, particularly the title song, and there are moments of inexpressible beauty in ""Among My Yesterdays,"" ""His Face"", ""In Buddy's Eyes"", ""This Nearly Was Mine"" and the medley of ""What'll I Do/Time Heals Everything"". Interspersed between the songs are her reflections of life in the Golden Age of musical theater - and these are just as delightful as the music.  This is a wise woman, happy with her past, present and future, and willing to share it with us. When she closes with a quiet ""The Party's Over,"" you wish it never had to end.

Later came the underappreciated Kyuss- which begat another band Queens Of The Stone Age (which was initially formed by two former members of Kyuss). The most recent entry into this subgenre is the duo Royal Blood- a British duo comprised of 25 year olds Mike Kerr and Ben Thatcher. The duo was formed in 2013 when singer and bassist Kerr and drummer Kerr- both of whom were in their early 20's at the time of Royal Blood's formation. That same year, they played their first live show together, which resulted them being championed by a member of the British indie rock band Arctic Monkeys. By the end of the year, Royal Blood went on tour to support Arctic Monkeys and ended up releasing a four track EP in early 2014 that was centered around singles they released up until that point. In August, they released their self titled debut which was self produced with recording engineer Tom Dalgery. The album was mixed by Dalgery with assistance from Alan Moulder (Best known for his work with Nine Inch Nails and Interpol) and Dave Sardy (System Of A Down, Jet).

Musically, their debut has the prevalent influence of 70's rockers Led Zeppelin and Rush. To best describe their debut, they sound like The White Stripes- that is if Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl was the drummer instead of Meg White. Though their sound is just drums and bass, it sounds like Royal Blood had at least five members in the band. Starting off the recording is the song ""Out Of The Black"", which shows a man reeling from a broken heart. They insist on wanting to run away from loneliness on ""Come On Over"", while sorting out their feelings on ""Figure It Out"". He tries to win back an ex despite being mistreated on ""You Can Be So Cruel"", while setting his sights on someone whose indifferent to them on the single ""Little Monster"". He has regrets over how he treated a former girlfriend on ""Careless"" and attempts to hold on to a failing relationship on the album closer ""Better Strangers"". Despite being very brief at barely 30 minutes, Royal Blood's self-titled debut is an album worth checking out.

B009GPGFJU,,5,"Keaton Henson's debut album, Dear, was a delicate heartfelt album of one man, his guitar and a lot of pain and care. This follow up is the sound of him expanding that sound slightly. Its almost like listening to a painfully shy man emerge, gain confidence and then retreat again. Like the man himself? Perhaps. But during this album that's the journey you will hear.

Early on the sound is eerily similar to the first album. Electric Guitar, that voice and not much else on Teach Me and the beautiful 10AM, Gare Du Nord. In fact it comes as a total shock when listening to The Best Today that the delicate approach is enhanced by drums and more noise. It feels that the man himself wants to try and mix things up and Don't Swim follows this and does the job. Starting in the usual mode of vocal and guitar Henson then decides to throw in a loud and brash guitar and drums instrumental piece towards the end of the track. It sounds like something almost Post Rock like. Its a wonderful addition.
Kronos then swaggers into view and could be on any rock album, snarling riffs and loud quiet approach this could be grunge music. Or maybe something Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith or similar company would consider too brash for their albums when they were making them. The Beekeeper has Banjo, drums and keyboards and sounds a little like some Fleetwood Mac tracks in its composition and chorus - think mid 70's country influenced Fleetwood Mac here though. Gradually though the noise and mood recedes and whilst Sweetheart, What Have You Done To Us has a return to the more introspective approach before horns take over.

As a second album this is a treat. Its definitely a step forward, a very interesting one too. There is an air of confidence and belief here. It will be interesting to see whether he retreats again or moves more towards the approach of drums and horns alongside his guitar. However, this is as good as the first album and I never thought I would say that.","03 17, 2013",A367LHR9MRCBDF,Syriat,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Blossoming Talent,1363478400,False,6,CDs_and_Vinyl

The songs all sound  rather similiar and there is no distinctive soloing that showcases any of  the band members talents and this perhaps is the worse part because  I know  that Brian Blade is an extremely talanted young musician.

B000004234,,4,"Collectors who like Tchaikovsky's orchestral works will want to consider this double CD set. It comprises recordings made in the 1970s by Antal Dorati conducting two American orchestras. The works include two that are less frequently performed than the others: ""Fatum"", an early work, and ""The Voyevode"", a late work.
  Collectors who become familiar with these works will notice that many of them are related to the idea that man is the plaything of a cruel fate. Shakespeare's dramas on this theme provided the inspiration and to some extent the program for three of the works. In the two works that were written to raise patriotic fervour - ""Marche slave"" and the ""1812 Overture"" - Tchaikovsky makes use of folk songs, as he does in ""Capriccio Italian"", a work he wrote after holidaying in Italy.
Collectors with an ear for acoustics might notice the special sound quality produced in the halls at Detroit and Washington where the works were recorded. Balance engineering seems to have been kept to a minimum. The aural perspective places you in the hall and fairly distant from the orchestra (although well within range of the canon!). Neither performances, nor the analogue sound are amongst the most exciting available on CD, but considerations of programming, convenience and economy should not be ignored.

B000060P63,,5,"""The French are glad to die for love"" is a line from the song Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend. In the case of the tenor hero in Offenbach's Tales Of Hoffman, this rings very true. Taken from a collection of stories by E.T.A. Hoffman, and the protoganist being himself Hoffman, it was Offenbach's swan song, his final opera and testament to his brilliance in the operatic theater. With all the charm of his earlier operettas, and with the darker stylings of serious opera, it is a moving experience. In this 1971 recording, we find everything perfect, a blend of fine score orchestration by Julius Rudel and the vocal talents of Beverly Sills, Stuart Burrows and Norman Treigle. Beverly Sills sings all three heroines, one of the rare breed of sopranos who do this, with the exception of Joan Sutherland, although Sills has a better dramatic flair and vocal beauty than Sutherland. If you listen closely, for this recording, she also sings the mezzo soprano role of Nicklausse, so she sings four women in total! What a remarkable woman Beverly is! Norman Treigle was the reigning baritone of New York City, a fine actor and the equivalent of Samuel Ramey today. In this recording, he portrays all the villains to perfection, diabolic timbres resonate in his voice, he laughs with evil inflection and is a fine actor. Stuart Burrows' Hoffman is his finest performance. He evokes a man in love, his tenor arias are embellished with charm and grace.
In Act I, after Treigle shows up in the tavern, belting out his villainous aria ""Dans les roles d'amoureaux"" where he says ""Comme un Diable"" (like a Devil), Hoffman enters and regales his drunking buddies with the tales of his loves, while also entertaining them with the legend of Kleizach. He then proceeds to tell the tales of his three loves, eventhough it's all clearly fiction.
In Act 2, Hoffman becomes an apprentice to the inventor Spalanzani, whose assistant is a robot named Cochenille. Hoffman mistakes Spalanzani's latest creation, a pretty doll, for his daughter. This illusion is further produced when the evil Coppelius gives Hoffman glasses to deceive him (J'ai des yeux). At the party Spalanzani throws, his robotic daughter Olympia sings the charming coloratura aria ""Les Oiseaux"". It is full of embellished trills up and down the vocal scale, and she winds down suddenly before she is wound up again to finish the song. Beverly's rendition is quite pretty, perhaps more true to Offenbach's original operetta take on the art song. When Coppelius takes revenge on Spalanzani who has not proved good on his former money deal, he takes revenge and breaks Olympia, causing Hoffman the ridicule of having loved an automaton. His shouts of ""Un Automaton!"" is exceptional. One can make the argument that for Offenbach, his last operetta had died with Olympia. Olympia's character, though shallow and insubstantial, can represent, if we analyze deeply, the innocent woman (Hoffman himself says in the opera she was an innocent), the shallow, trophy wife, naive young society girl who was trained in the French Second Empire 19th century to look as pretty as a doll, to entertain house guests and to have not much to say other than ""Oui"" ""Yes!"".
In Act 3, Hoffman finds himself in Venice. Here, among the company of gondoliers, merrymakers and a beautiful courtesan, Giuletta, he sings a rousing brindisi (Amis, l'amour tendre et reveur error (my friends, falling in love is a big mistake!) in which he vows never to love another woman for risk of feeling heartbreak. But Dappertuto, an evil magician, wants Hoffman's soul and makes Giuletta seduce Hoffman for his reflection. It does not take long before Hoffman serenades Giuletta with his signature love theme, ""O Dieu di quelle ivresse!"". Hoffman gives up his soul, and upon discovery of this, a beautiful ensemble ensues, the sextet chorus ""Helas, mon couer"" (Alas, my heart has once again deceived me). The opera ends with the chorus take on how it began, the Barcarolle. Giuletta abandons Hoffman and the villain wins again.
In Act 4, Hoffman follows Crespel, a violin maker, and his daugther Antonia (whom he loves) to Munich. Antonia's mother was a great opera singer, but died mysteriously of consumption after a check up from the sinister quack doctor, Miracle. Hoffman convinces Antonia not to sing again, lest she risk her own life, and they propose to elope. But Dr. Miracle makes her sing when a portrait of her mother shouts ""Cher, Enfante, que j'appelle"" (dear child, I call to you!). Beverly Sills takes on the moment brilliantly, as Dr. Miracle urges her to sing more dramatically with the swelling of violin chords, and Beverly shouts "" Et que mon ame vole aux cieux (and my soul rises to heaven), a blazing high note that sounds like a shooting star at the end of track 21. Antonia dies. Hoffman is blamed and Dr. Miracle's baritone voice sounds its most ghastliest when he pronounces ""Morte!"". Finally, in the last act, Hoffman finishes his tales and has drunk himself stupid. He hallucinates about the Muse who inspires him and pledges his love for her, eventhough Stella, the woman he genuinely loved and made into all three heroines in his fiction, goes to pick him up but abandons him in the arms of the villain.
A romantic work of opera and theater that is not to be missed. This is also Beverly Sill's finest works, right along side her Three Queens and Manon. Beverly Sills' French repertoire was her favorite and the most easily vocally. It also provided her with fine acting. Five Stars well deserved. Who cares if this is not the ""complete"" edition. It is still highly entertaining.","12 18, 2002",A5ZUZ49YRDPCV,Rachel Garret,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},The Most Romantic French Opera,1040169600,False,3,CDs_and_Vinyl

B00004SV6S,,5,"After the disappointing releases of ""X Factor"" (1995) and ""Virtual XI"" (1998), vocalist Blaze Bayley left to pursue his own solo career.  The spark of Maiden seems to have left the band, but a light at the end of the tunnel opens for this great heavy metal band.  Bruce Dickinson decides to return to the band that made him famous and convinces guitarist Adrian Smith to rejoin his former bandmates.  With that, they set out on another tour and recorded their latest studio album, ""Brave New World"" (2000).  With Janick Gers staying and allowing Maiden to be a triple-guitar-assault, here's the lowdown:
The Wicker Man - Great opening track.  The last part (""whooa"") is a little weak, but no complaints.  Some fans remarked that this sounds too much like the Judas Priest classic Running Wild.  My response: shut up and enjoy.
Ghost of the Navigator - One of the epics.  This one is a GREAT track with Bruce in fine form.  Kinda reminds me of Rime of the Ancient Mariner.
Brave New World - the title track.  Really good, in my opinion.  I think the chorus is a little repetitive, but it's still a solid song in the Maiden tradition.  Dave's solo is terrific.
Blood Brothers - THE BEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM.  I love this song!  Steve really wrote a terrific song here and Bruce's vocals enhance it greatly.  Just a brilliantly written melodic rocker.  Everything about this is great.
The Mercenary - A meaty rocker with great guitars.  This song is a little weaker in comparison to the others, but it's good by all means.
Dream of Mirrors - I never really cared for this one at first.  I like it now, though.  Good melodic guitars and a midtempo beat make this song a Maiden staple.  Bruce's vocals are excellent as always.  I highly recommend listening to this, even though it isn't as good as the tracks before it.
Fallen Angel - Probably the weakest track on the album, but it's a solid rocker by all means.  Adrian's solo is excellent and the chorus is quite infectious.
The Nomad - Ah, another epic!  A great track and is brilliantly written.  It has a strong flavor akin to ""Powerslave.""  Harks back to the old days of Maiden.
Out of the Silent Planet - GREAT track.  This one often goes overlooked for some reason, even though this and The Wicker Man were singles in Europe.  Bruce's vocals hit their peak in this song and the guitars weaving in and out enhance this one.  Why fans complain about the opening guitar lick by Janick Gers is beyond me.
The Thin Line Between Love and Hate - WHY FANS DISS ON THIS ONE JUST BAFFLES ME.  I've seen reviews where they say ""this song is weak,"" when it reality it's not.  This one's a midtempo rocker and the vocals are a bit weird at first, but I really like this song.  Bruce's vocals shine here as well.  Good way to end an album.
As for the fans that say ""it's not as good as the 80s Maiden,"" get off your high horse.  This one's great.  It may not quite measure up to ""Somewhere in Time"" or ""Number of the Beast,"" but this one's the best Maiden album IN A LONG TIME.  We haven't had a good album like this since ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"" back in 1988.  If anything, this proves that with Bruce and Adrian back in the fold, Maiden can still live on and bring forth good, arena-style heavy metal that we've all come to know and love.  With that said, don't wait... buy this album and give it a listen.

B01FIB7KVC,,3,"I'm mostly reviewing the vinyl for people who want to buy the album and aren't sure whether to spend the extra money for the vinyl version.

But first, about the music itself:  This is a fun collection of laid-back and mostly lesser known music that I think is inoffensive at worst and enjoyable (though not essential for most people) at best.  Judge for yourself:  you can stream the album on Spotify, TIDAL, etc, or listen to the track samples here.  I give the music 3 1/2 to 4 stars and I don't think most people would regret spending $12 for the CD.

But what if you're a vinyl enthusiast?  The LP costs more than twice as much as the CD, is it worth it?

In my opinion, no.  I have the LP version and a good enough stereo system to tell the difference between really good sounding LPs, average ones, and poor ones.  This is an average-sounding record.

The pressing itself is quite good.  The record is perfectly flat with no flaws.  The problem is the audio of the master used to make this record.  The audio master sounds as compressed as the CD or CD-quality FLACs of this recording.  Basically, listening to the LP is like listening to the CD but with the potential of an LP's surface noise and pops and scratches.

I love vinyl records, but they're less convenient than digital media for sure.  And they cost a lot more.  So I only recommend buying the LP if it sounds better.  This LP doesn't, and isn't worth the money in my opinion.

B00WMCORYE,,5,"Mark Tremonti is at the top of his game again!
If you've listened to the first Tremonti album, you know exactly what to expect here. The guitars are brutal and beautiful, the double bass driven drums are simply amazing, and Mark's vocals are even more refined than before.
If you don't know this band, this is something you need to discover. Guitar player and band leader for multi-platinum post-gunge band Creed, and the man at the helm of the world renowned Alter Bridge, Mark Tremonti has branched out into his own project so he can use the shredding and thundering guitar chops that are simply too heavy and over the top for those bands. The music is more akin to a modern day thrash metal with songs structured to fit the post-grunge/alt-metal frame. Mark has hand-picked the musicians from the likes of Submersed and Van Halen to round out his line-u for this band. And they are all at the top of their respective fields right now. There is major guitar brutality spread throughout this album, along with plenty of heart and feeling. Top it off with the most introspective and personal lyrics Mark has ever written, and you have what amounts to the perfect Hard Rock sound. If you can only imagine some of today's heaviest bands but without the screaming and whining vocals, but a more clean and refined sound, then you're on the right track.
It's hard to say this album is better than the first, but I would go as far as to say it is at least as good.
Like I said, this is something that just needs to be experienced. You can't use small song samples and a couple radio tracks to judge what you'll get here. If you're a fan of heavy rock music, heavy metal, post-grunge, alternative metal, or anything like that, this record belongs at the very top of that mountain.

B00006GA0U,,4,"Regardless of what anybody says, this mini-album is still fresh and top-notch -- Krs-One style. This is NOT just a CD that focuses on dissing Nelly. Just because it has the song ""Ova Here"" on this, doesn't mean that the rest of the subject matter is pin-pointed in that direction. Krs-One expresses his usual knowledge on tracks like ""The Message 2002"" and ""Splash."" Even a song like ""Down the Charts"" is very real with the message of the modern Hip Hop industry. The beats were raw and Krs-One's delivery is amazingly hype as expected. Yeah, everyone who was disappointed with his previous effort on ""Spiritual Minded"" should at least appreciate the Blast Master's revival. This CD sounds very similar to ""The Sneak Attack,"" another album that I really enjoyed. But then again, only the truest of Krs fans would still love this effort. It's nowhere near the status of his earlier projects with BDP and ""Return of the Boom Bap"" -- but it still exists in its own credentials.

B000002I7R,,5,"""Pictures at Eleven"" appears like 'a solo album from that guy from Led Zeppelin' type of deal, rather than a singer trying to find a voice. Perhaps he wasn't sure if zeppelin were on hiatus or something. This disc succeeds at presenting Robert as he was at the time, not really trying to cash in on zep or move away too fast. The perfect balance between retaining an indentity as a solo artist and acknowledging your past as 1/4 of Led Zeppelin. Additionally, unlike Plant's future work, there are really no dogs or bombs or stinkers or awkward moments (e.g.-""If I were a carpentar"" cover). To each his own, I suppose; but I enjoy this album. Not comfortable to admit it, but I like  especially ""slow dancer"", ""Moonlight in Samosa"" and ""Fat Lip""(sp?)...The best all around Plant effort. He sounds as if he wrote songs for a band with him being 1/4 member, much in the vein of Led Zeppelin's approach, which contrasts to his ""solo star w/ backing band style"" of later years.

Should have been as big as Humble Pie or Sabbath or Purple - but criminally Wales's finest power trio weren't. Yet today they not only elicit as much affection as they did four decades ago but are name-checked as hugely seminal influences on the likes of Metallica, Soundgarden and even Van Halen all of whom have covered their tunes with pride and glee.

Personally - Christmas 1972 and a 14-year old Markipoos has an LP pressy waiting for him beneath the festooned tree - their second album ""Squawk"" in a Dolphin Discs record bag! I've loved this Welsh power trio for over 45 years and this dinky Remaster Box Set that features 3 of their 5 albums on MCA Records in the 70ts has only sent me off on one. So much to love on here - but let's get to the original grunge rockers first...

UK released Friday, 2 June 2016 (10 June 2016 in the USA) - ""The MCA Years 1973-1975"" by BUDGIE on MCA Records/Universal UMC 5363393 (Barcode 600753633939) is a 3CD Hard Card Slipcase Mini Box Set with new 2016 Remasters (with no Bonus Tracks) and plays out as follows:

Disc 1 ""Never Turn Your Back On A Friend"" (41:50 minutes):
1. Breadfan
2. Baby Please Don't Go
3. You Know I'll Always Love You
4. You're The Biggest Thing Since Powdered Milk
5. In The Grip Of A Tyrefitter's Hand [Side 2]
6. Hiding My Nightmare
7. Parents
Tracks 1 to 7 are their 3rd studio album ""Never Turn Your Back On A Friend"" - released June 1973 in the UK on MCA Records MDKS 8010 (reissued MCA Records MCG 3513 in 1974)

Disc 2 ""In For The Kill"" (41:12 minutes):
1. In For The Kill
2. Crash Course In Brain Surgery
3. Wondering What Everyone Knows
4. Zoom Club
5. Hammer And Tongs [Side 2]
6. Running From My Soul
7. Living On Your Own
Tracks 1 to 7 are their 4th studio album ""In For The Kill"" - released June 1974 in the UK on MCA Records MCF 2546 and in the USA on MCA Records MCA 429

Disc 3 ""Bandolier"" (34:08 minutes):
1. Breaking All The House Rules
2. Slipaway
3. Who Do You Want For Your Love?
4. I Can't See My Feelings
5. I Ain't No Mountain
6. Napoleon Bona - Part 1
7. Napoleon Bona - Part 2
Tracks 1 to 7 are their 5th and last studio album for MCA Records ""Bandolier"" - released September 1975 in the UK on MCA Records MCF 2723 and in the USA on MCA Records MCA 4618

The first thing fans will notice is that the 2 or 3 Bonus Tracks that came with the 2004 singular Remasters of each album are AWOL - which is a damn shame because (a) they were good and (b) there's plenty of room (the non-album B-side ""Honey"" from the ""I Ain't No Mountain"" UK and US 7"" single would have been a perfect addition for example). On the upside the ""Never Turn Your Back On A Friend"" LP was always a gatefold with that Roger Dean artwork cover and the live shots of the band (and lyrics) on the inner gatefold - that's been reproduced in the rather tasty oversized card sleeve. But both ""In For The Kill"" and ""Bandolier"" original LPs only came with single sleeves - here they've been given gatefolds with promo photos of the band on the inside. Each CD is also colour coded with the 'Budgie In A Spacesuit' Logo on each disc.

Noted writer and Music Historian MALCOLM DOME has done the excellent liner notes inside the colourful 16-page booklet. There's references to Producer Roger Bain (had Sabbath connections) who did so much to define their grungy hard rock sound on the July 1971 debut ""Budgie"" and its September 1972 follow-up ""Squawk"" and a nod to British DJ 'Kid Jensen' getting behind the first album on Pirate Radio thereby giving BUDGIE a career and following in Europe. There are 7"" picture sleeves for rare foreign issues of the singles ""Crash Course In Brain Surgery"" and ""Zoom Club"" and a trade advert for the ""I Ain't No Mountain"" 45 as well as comments from key band members like Bourke Shelley and tributes from uberfans Dave Mustaine from Megadeath and Lars Ulrich from Metallica.

But the really great news is the AUDIO that absolutely rocks like the proverbial mother and her 'f' word. ANDY PEARCE has revisited the original mastertapes (he did a great job on the 2012 Rory Gallagher reissues) and these CDs trounce the 1991 and 2004 versions I've had for years. These transfers are loud and ballsy - but not loud for the sake of it. As the tracks play you can really hear that guitar - that chunky bass - those drum whacks. It's properly rocking and on stuff like the slide genius of ""Breadfan"" or the sweet ballad ""Wondering What Everyone Knows"" or the sheer riffage in the brilliant ""Breaking All The House Rules"" - the sound is genuinely great and makes everything feel new again.

With that Audio in mind - these albums suddenly feel far better than I remember them. Every Budgie fan loves ""Never Turn Your Back..."" with their blistering cover of Big Joe Williams and his R&B hit ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and the speaker-to-speaker hard rock of ""In The Grip Of A Tyrefitter's Hand"" - but suddenly that swirling Acoustic Guitar in the pretty ballad ""Riding My Nightmare"" seems huge - as does the doomy 10-minute-plus guitars of ""Parents"". There's a part about a minute in when it slows to Acoustic Guitar, Bass and echoed Lead - and the Remaster is fantastic.

I always felt ""In For The Kill"" showed the band going slightly off the boil even though it was their first to chart in Britain at No. 29. But again - there's real muscle in the kick-ass chug of ""In For The Kill"" sounding down right dirty and mean (""...when I was born I was given a will..."") - nice. The 1971 non-album single ""Crash Course In Brain Surgery"" was supposedly given a slight remix for the 1974 album version but I'm buggered if I can actually hear any difference between this and the Roger Bain produced original (great tune though). The drums of Ray Phillips were replaced by Phil Boot for ""In For The Kill"" and you can hear it on the finisher ""Living On Your Own"" - a deceptively complex tune where guitarist Tony Bourge stretches out and Bourke Shelley gives it his best strangulated Geddy Lee vocals.

But the big winner here is ""Bandolier"" - an album I'd completely forgotten about. The opening ""Breaking All The House Rules"" is 7:22 minutes of fabulous Rock 'n' Roll riffage where Budgie sounds like Scott Gorham/Brian Robertson Thin Lizzy at their tightest and expressive best. And the Audio is just brilliant too. The treated Acoustic ballad ""Slipaway"" is again gorgeously reproduced as is the strangely Funky ""Who Do You Want For Your Love?"" They manage a Hard Rock version of Andy Fairweather-Lowe's ""I Ain't No Mountain"" (from his 1974 A&M album ""Spider Jivin'"") and is the nearest Budgie get to being commercial sounding a little like Nazareth in search of a Top Ten hit. The 2-parts of ""Napoleon Bona"" are close to 'Rush' Prog Rock and again the Remaster just elevates everything - and you can 'so' hear where Metallica got 'that' sound as the guitars riff like a goodun towards the end of Part 1.

Perfection would have been all five of the iconic MCA LPs including those first two masterpieces from 1971 and 1972. But what's on offer here (at just under eight-quid) is incredible value for money and a great reminder as to why BUDGIE still engenders such affection amongst ageing rockers like me whilst drawing in clued-up Metal newcomers too.

B00SW8W8ZC,,5,"Three Sides of Henry Mancini, NOT3CD188

CD1: 52.31; CD2: 58.17 & CD3: 58.19

The set covers 3 different areas of music and this lends itself to the CD titles The Lighter Side; The Jazzy Side & The Darker Side. The music collected here comes from the late 1950 s and early 1960s and has 46 Henry Mancini compositions out of the 54 numbers included.

Many of the numbers will be familiar so I am not going to list them and the ones you do not recognise by name are either from film or television shows for which he wrote a massive amount of music. The fascinating thing is the way he can adapt to very different musical genres and clearly be successful at all of them...what a superb musician...

Henry Mancini was one of the first international stars to play Symphony Hall in  Birmingham when it opened and I can still remember the musical atmosphere that he and the musicians created that evening...this CD set gets pretty close to the magic of that night for me. I cannot recommend it highly enough...

I can suggest this set to those who want some of the best recordings he ever made and somehow I think this is a set you will play often. I have had it on 3 times already...

B00004VVZN,,4,"...opera, including the essential Masonic references. Klemperer does not neglect the more buoyant, positive areas, such as the Papageno/Papagena romance and Sarastro's effective benevolence. Some slowish tempi are occasionally problematic, but not nearly so damagingly as in his 1972 Cosi (see my review). Orchestral playing is superb, especially the winds. As with
Karl Bohm's great Decca Magic Flute from 1955, which I prefer to his 1964 DG remake, I don't mind the absent dialogue
which some find more necessary than I.

The cast is mostly superb, with three of the leads ideal or close to it.  Popp (Queen) and Janowitz (Pamina) sing with
consummate skill and beauty.  Berry is again a lithe and affecting Papageno, not as youthful and spry as in 1955 for Bohm but a bit livelier than in his 1974 Papageno for Sawallisch.  Gottlob Frick is an imposing Sarastro with a deep bass. Luxury casting permeates the performance, from the Three Ladies to the Three Boys and the Two Priests. The one exception to the praise is the Tamino of Nicolai Gedda, and it is based on a subjective aversion to his voice which has deepened over the years, not to his interpretive skill/artistry.  I prefer such Taminos as Anton Dermota and Fritz Wunderlich for Bohm and Stuart Burrows for Solti/1969. Solti's male trio I find  ideal: Burrows, Prey and Talvela (see my review), and Prey is my favorite Papageno. But vocally Klemperer's cast is difficult to fault.  If only he had also Cosi ca 1960.

Because it's completely different than anything he's done, it's well composed, well written and finally Gary has put a piece of his soul into something on tape. What we have here is a dark album, backed by incredible production and industrial very heavy sound that works in non-cliche form. Gary's vocals are very powerful here, it sounds as if he's borrowing from everything he knows (including his Opera experience) to really go over the top.

This fit nowhere in his record collection, alongside his Dead Kennedys and Exploited albums, yet it made complete sense once I listened to it: it's more punk than any of those old hardcore bands because Mr. Bungle truely doesn't try to be what anyone expected them to be.  Organs, metal guitars, a brass section, and some damn funny lyrics made this album not only stand out as completely unique, but considering it was released by Warner Bros., it was by far the least commercial album released by anyone for many years before and after, meaning that they truely released art, not something targeted at a specific demographic, not another quick-signing to cash in on the grunge movement (this WAS released in 1991), and not even an attempt to sell records due to Faith No More's populartiy at the time, since Mike Patton's name was nowhere on the record, yet his voice is unmistakeable.  No hit singles, no radio airplay, this one sold only by listening to it at a friend's house then going out and buying it yourself; luckily, there were plenty of friends who turned on other friends, as Mr. Bungle released two other albums so far, which are both equally as good as their debut here.","03 23, 2003",AAJGZZS6GFFBR,Eric A.

B000GY729M,,5,"When I first played this album I wasn't quite sure what to think.  Brandon Flowers' voice sounds markedly thinner and more waver-y at points than it does on Hot Fuss.  The immediate grandeur of the material, bookmarked as it is with the ornate, sometimes frilly intro / outtro combination, sets up this sophomore followup for polarizing reactions from the band's fans.

There were only one or two immediate tunes that caught me.  I nervously listened to the album again.  And a third time.  And it is awesome.  I do have some misgivings about the way it is recorded.  (Unlike the band's stunning debut, there are some songs on Sam's Town that I will outright skip--they try too hard or just don't work for me.  And there are some noticeable pitch problems with the vocals--baffling on a major-label, Flood-produced album.)  But yet.  It has not left my car stereo.  There is some great, inspired work here.  Stuff that draws me into its energetic, wistful, stylized vibe as skillfully as anything on Hot Fuss.  Stuff that deserves repeated exploration.  Stuff that rekindles my excitement about music.

This album is like a second date: you realize that your new crush has flaws you hadn't noticed the first time around, but you're just that much more endeared.  And flustered.

B0019C6J2G,,5,"This set of Brahms was mostly recorded in 1963 at the Victoria Hall, Geneva in Switzerland. The choral works followed and were completed in 1966. The Victoria Halls was a favourite venue for the Decca recording engineers as it had wonderful acoustics and even today, over 55 years later, this recording easily stands the test of time as a superior audio product of its time. The Suisse Romande Orchestra did not always have a reputation for infallible technical security but throughout this set they prove to be more than capable of inspirational playing of complete security.

Ernest Ansermet, their chief conductor, was noted for his devotion to the printed notes in the musical scores that he conducted. He was opposed to anything that was added by interpreters in the form of false emotional overlays preferring to concentrate on structural clarity and directness of expression.

That approach perfectly suits all of these works resulting in music-making strong in verve on the one hand and illuminating on the other by making clear so many details that are so frequently lost in the lushness of other performances.

A strong sense of internal and forward motion is frequently apparent in the orchestral works in particular. This is achieved by observation of countless internal details as referred to above. As with any other lifetime collector of recordings one gets to become familiar with a considerable number of fine alternatives and knows what to expect and what to appreciate. It therefore comes as quite a shock to find a recording, and especially one of this vintage, that has escaped previous notice and one that still has so much more to add to ones awareness. That is the measure of Ansermets achievement in this central repertoire.

There are those who claim that this Brahms survey by Ansermet amounts to one of the most satisfying surveys available on disc. This is a brave claim to make but after listening to these recordings with a growing sense of respect and noting the way that Ansermet consistently places the demands of the music ahead of any other consideration, one is tempted to re-evaluated previously admired readings in the light of these and to add these to the list of essential readings at the very least.

The orchestral works are consistently fine including the second symphony that some other reviewers have found wanting in elemental energy. This has not been this reviewers experience. It is worth noting that Ansermet observes the repeats in the middle symphonies but not elsewhere. Apparently Brahms himself was also variable in terms of observing his own repeats so Ansermet seems to be in good company on that score.

The choral works are also fine with tempi chosen to allow the texts to make a strong impact. The German Requiem in particular has come in for special praise from reviewers who respond well to these choral works. As one less sympathetic to those works it is easy to acknowledge their commitment while admitting to having a greater interest in the purely orchestral items in this impressive and temptingly low priced set.

You've still got the great heavy stuff, as well as ballads, sythesizers, acoustics, even solos.  There's all kinds of good stuff here.  The band sounds better than ever, and Corey proves once again he's an awesome vocalist.

B000002UD1,,4,"Mind Games is one of those Beatle solo album that has some very good songs on it but is not quite a classic. The problem with most Beatle solo albums is that they close to produce themselves and often in rock and roll, that is a mistake. Had Lennon gotten an outside producer, this record could very well had been a classic like Imagine and Plastic Ono Band.  With that being said, there are some great songs on Mind Games. The song Mind Games is a classic even though it is one of Lennon's most under praised solo singles and also one of his least successful(#18 on the charts). The best song on the album though is Meat City which was the b side to Mind Games. It is the most experimental, humerous and cutting edge Lennon track of his solo career. The fact that this song is not contained on any of his compilations-greatest hits is such a shame. Other stand out songs on the record are Out of the Blue which sounds like it could have been on the White Album and I'm Sorry which is one of Lennon's most depressing tracks that he ever recorded. This is a good solid CD and is worth the purchase even though it is very unrated.","02 6, 2001",AIMB1P3QHOFG4,Eric D. Putnam,,Close to a classic,981417600,False,,CDs_and_Vinyl

It has not lost it's freshness in the sense that the music is almost pop/rock classic status to this day ! The soundtrack is one cohesive suite that works with all the various artists and genres compiled...Jan Hammer was to Miami Vice what Vangelis was to Chariots of Fire and other film scores. Glenn Frey's and Phil Collins' and Tina Turner's tracks gave the soundtrack that much needed sophisticated rock edge. Otherwise, the soundtrack would have been just a glitzy synth pop fad project with a couple of dance tunes and a rap track...The other less standout artists do indeed stand out in their own right! Chaka Khan's frenetic and upbeat dance track Own The Night serves as a counterpoint to the other rock edged tracks. Melle Mel's Vice is a sample or intro as to how far the impact rap would later have on the music world for the next decade and beyond...","10 1, 2002",A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,Armando M.

I don't know how any meat puppets fan could dislike this album it's probobly my third favorite album of theres. Every song is so colorful and the album as a whole paints the picture of the album cover when you hear it. The opening of the album starts off with curts psycadellic guitar which is the intro to the laid back title track. Quit it is an all out Meat Puppets rocker which you can't help but really get into. Get on down is a funny song where the music just makes you want to do a stupid little dance as well as sing along too. The lyrics have to do with taking your car apart and what not. A Hundred Miles is probobly my favorite track where the music in the verses have a get up and grove beat and the chorus is the part of the song that rocks! If you liked Up on the Sun, Meat Puppets II, and Too High to Die then you will most likely love this and your collection should not be without this.

I have been using their screen protectors for over 4 years starting with both of my Galaxy S4s, and now both of my Galaxy S6 Actives. I also purchased their protector for my Samsung GearFit band.

Because there was an issue with the original version of the case being too loose for the AT&T model, which is the one I have, I was sent the newer version of the case at no cost. I was also promised a refund which I am still waiting on, but that has nothing to do with the actual product. The new case fit perfectly and, to my relief, actually holds on to the phone! It looks slightly different from the old model but it seems to cover the same areas of the phone. The issue with air pockets appearing due to contact between the phone and the case worsened with the newer version, but I can't be too picky with cosmetic things like that as the newer version gives me more peace of mind.

That said, I updated the review from 2 stars to 4 stars. While it does do its job, the cosmetic issues do exist which prevents me from giving it a 5. I would recommend this case if you do not mind the air pockets. If anything, buy a version that isn't clear and you would probably love it.

Old review (7/11/12):

My phone is an AT&T model and I find myself easily pushing the phone off the case or peeling the case off the phone. The case is too loose. This is apparently a known issue. In addition, the back of the phone sticks to the case, creating visible unappealing air bubbles. I will be contacting the seller to try to resolve the issue.

The screen protector that came with the case is decent, except it does not stick to the edges of the phone. This will eventually turn into a dust harbor. Not an issue for me as I plan on changing my screen protector often. Otherwise, the display is still very clear and I'm happy with it.","07 11, 2012",A3RDS0DJ5EJGA7,B,{'Color:': ' clear'},"Edited: Case ""WAS"" loose, new case received",1341964800,True,,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

B00E2TT8W6,,5,"I took the OXA Juice Box S2 10,000mAh external battery with me on a camping trip and it performed fantastically.  Over the weekend, I recharged my iPhone 5 twice from about 50-100% and 20-100%, and my girlfriend charged her Galaxy S3 for about 30 minutes (I didn't check the percentages).  When I looked at the battery level at the end of the weekend it was still at 65%.

It's about the size of a larger digital camera, so it's still pocketable, but I thought it was a little heavy to carry around in my pant pockets comfortably.  The built-in flashlight is a pretty nice bonus feature, and the LED display actually tells you the exact percentage of battery remaining.

There are two USB ports for charging 1A devices like iPhones and a 2.1A port for larger phones and tablets SIMULTANEOUSLY.

My worst nightmare is having that type of mount directly above my inspection sticker and having this happen with the window down, and my phone and mount flying out the window.  Hasn't happened yet, but I thought about it all the time, until i purchased these magnetic mounts.  These work great, with two different width slots to slide onto vents that you magnetically stick your phone to using a metal plate stuck to your phone (without a case) or sandwiched between your phone and case.  Very easy to set up and use.  One drawback is that you don't want to use the vent for heat in the winter if your phone is attached to it, because it'll overheat your phone.  One benefit in summer is that the A/C will keep your phone cool so it doesn't overheat.
 Other than that, works flawlessly.  You should be able to find a pair of these for $5-$6, so shop around.","12 30, 2017",AXTRWH1EBC2JP,konz,,Great product - recommended.,1514592000,True,,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

I need a case that was not only waterproof, but also didn't add a lot of bulk and weight.  As a long distance runner the last thing I need is the extra size (the iPhone 6 Plus is big enough as it is) and this case allowed me the protection that I needed without having to deal with the pitfalls of the other cases I've tried. As I do with all ""waterproof"" equipment I tested it before I put my electronics in it with a piece of tissue and the Sunwukin case delivered waterproof protection...twice. I did a standard test in my sink in a pot of water and then in the pool with me for my laps.  After an hour at depths ranging from 1-5 feet the case didn't leak a single drop.  I had access to all my ports and remarkably also had use of the fingerprint scanner as well.  The only thing I didn't test was the waterproof headphones adapter because I use bluetooth headphones.  Speaking of Bluetooth, my headphone and WiFi had no problems connecting and staying connected with the case on. Finally, my power charger (I use the stock Lightning cord) fit with the case on making this a waterproof case that can be used as a day to day case (had access to all the ports).  Although I was given the case for free to test and give an honest opinion, that in no way swayed my review.  I would, without ANY hesitation, recommend this case to all my friends and family members!","02 3, 2016",AQOK6MJUHQV2A,Ray Jerauld,{'Color:': ' Black'},A Waterproof Case Slim Enough for Day to Day Use!!!!,1454457600,False,,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories
B00OY5T3OQ,,4,"I have been a loyal Tech Armor fan for the last few iPhones I've gone through (since the iPhone 4S). The Ballistic Glass protectors have saved my screen more times than I can count. I've had the Tech Armor shatter - take the hit - while saving the $200 screen underneath. I cannot say enough about the Tech Armor Ballistic Glass Screen Protectors. I've tried to get everyone I know to use one - my wife & father have them on both phones and iPads. They are COMPLETELY worth the money.

As far as this one for the iPhone 6 (I got the edge-to-edge version), I keep it in a Mophie case. I'm not too sure about this one. A few concerns:

1. The install didn't seem as simple as it did for my last phone (iPhone 5S). Maybe the shape & contours of the phone - not sure. I was able to get it on straight enough, but the coverage looks ""off"".
2. Install Part 2 - it doesn't ""look"" like it offers the same amount of protection as the previous one. Again, maybe the phone design and I certainly can't fault Tech Armor for that.
3. The colored sections - this is more of a gripe. I don't really care for that. I almost didn't get the edge-to-edge one because of this. Now that it's installed it doesn't look bad, but you absolutely can tell that it's part of the screen protector and not the phone.

Really, with Tech Armor Ballistic Glass you can't go wrong. Be sure to take your time when cleaning and installing the protector - not something you want to rush or you will regret it. Just read and follow the directions that are included and be careful once you start and everything should go smoothly.

**UPDATE (11.21.2015): The E2E Ballistic Glass Screen Protectors I had ordered when I first upgraded to the iPhone 6 has held up as well as all of the others. My only complaint is that it doesn't curve around the edge - however that's more of a gripe about Apple's design for rounding the edges of the phone. As a testament to the performance of these screen protectors, I just ordered 2 more (the new ones are ""hybrid"" - designed to fit both the iPhone 6 & iPhone 6S). Unless some radical design change occurs I can't see myself buying a different screen protector. A Verizon rep tried telling me that theirs was superior, however it was double the price, did not have Tech Armor's warranty, and I *know* Tech Armor works as I've had them save multiple phone screens. Absolutely one of the best screen protectors on the market.","08 19, 2015",AQ0F4V2H054UV,TexasBuckeye,{'Color:': ' Glass E2E Black'},Tech Armor Ballistic Glass - Rounds 4 & 5,1439942400,True,,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

B000J2XZ1K,,4,"We bought this unit about a year ago and it helped.  We live way out in the sticks and are probably 3-5 miles (as the crow flies) from the cell tower.  Before setting up the booster we were lucky to get any service in the house.  Afterwards we could get 2 or 3 bars, but had to stay fairly close to the base unit.  Recently I added the dual-band directional antenna and our signal strength on both of our iPhone4's is maxed out at 5 bars throughout most of the house.  This product is worth the money as long as you remember to also purchase the directional antenna if you are in a far fringe area.  Adding the external antenna seems to increase the range of the base unit.

Update (09-13-10): I have found one complaint.  So far I am on my third OEM power supply.  The little power block died at about the same time as a lightning storm went through and made our house power hiccup so I'm not sure what knocked out the block (yes, it IS on a surge protector).  I bought a variable DC power supply as a backup since I could not find a ""generic"" power supply that would work (3.6VDC, 2.0A). I also added a grounding wire on my outdoor antenna.  Since then I haven't had a problem.  All I am saying is I wish they would include a little more robust power supply with this unit.  I still think the unit is worth it, just think about an additional power supply if you are susceptible to power failures, lightning strikes or both.","05 24, 2010",A38R7G4PREOMLE,R.

B00LAEA8E8,,5,My wife and I were so excited when these phones arrived. They arrived on time. They are brand new and shiny! Which may not matter to most people but when you get a new phone the newness is a big factor. The Price was very fair and the phones worked great out of the boxes. They were everything the Vendor said they were. They charged with no issues and we got them for use with Verizon. We took them to Verizon and getting our service up and running went great with no hitches. The rep was surprised at the price we paid for them as well. We also got the Android update Marshmallow 6.01 and these phones have a even better Android OS and have more functionality as well. We are very happy with these phones and the would buy from this Vendor with no hesitation!! I know Samsung is up to Galaxy S7 but I didn't have to spend $600 to $700 to get a great phone.

The volume button is on the back of the phone.  Again, bad placement.  Changing the volume is a chore.

The case comes with a great little kickstand, which is nice to be able to set the phone down while sitting at my desk. It also has a clip on holster, which is a great feature for some people, but I'm not planning on utilizing. But the holster seems well built and useful.

For me there is one issue.  The focal distance is wrong for me.  Older eyes ;(  The lenses screw in and out toward your eye to focus.  If I have them all the way toward my eyes the focus is almost ok.  Any further they fall out or probably touch your eyes.  Or if I move them forward just enough to be solid and I move the phone to the front/outside of the headset and hold it with my hands the focus is perfect.

If you don't have an eyesight problem like me, this is probably a very good VR headset.

I'm not sure where to go with this now.  Different lenses would probably fix it.","01 21, 2016",A2NOYQWJCLDDRS,buddy,,Good fit for my S5 and lots of fun.  Wrong focal length for me.,1453334400,True,,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories
B009WDWBH6,,4,"I had the same case for my Galaxy Nexus and like it on both phones.  The protection is great, the phones have survived drops without a problem and the plastic holds up well.  Despite the extra mm (what whatever it is) it actually makes the phone easier to hold with the ribbed sides.

The fit is great, you just have to make sure you line up one of the ends with the connections properly then push it on.  If you don't do that it may not fit well, however that's user error.  If you use a screen protector see below.

Drawbacks:
The first is likely only an issue for a white Note 2 and is minor and more personal preference.  It just looks a little awkward with the white/silver trim making and a lot of that has to do with the sides blocking you from seeing the trim which breaks up the look of the phone.  However I'm a function over form person so I'm happy with the grippy sides, but just a warning for those who prefer looks first.

With the clear ""color"" if you take the case off and any dust/dirt manages to get in there you see it clearly (pun intended) when looking at the back of your phone and you'll spend time trying to clean the rubber.  If you take your cases off a lot for whatever reason (swap battery, dock, etc) you won't want clear regardless of case maker.

If you use a screen protector and how much room it leaves on the edges.  I use the ones the Verizon store sell in those 3-packs.  The first one I put on wasn't lines up right and offset to the left where it covered the screen fine but the case would push against the film's edge and make it come off.  I then put on a second one dead center and have had no problems.  So be aware if you have a screen protector and if it fits from edge to edge it will likely not work well with this case and keep popping off.

However if you're fine with this drawbacks going in it is a good product and I plan on continuing to use it.","01 3, 2013",A25P1BXEEKBAO7,AmazonGuy2929,"{'Color:': ' Clear', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",Good case with some minor drawbacks,1357171200,True,,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

Camera is definitely better
Octa core processor and 3Gb RAM and 32Gb storage for this price? How much does any competitor with these specifications cost?
User Interface is a lot more logical, therefore fluidity is awesome
Screen with its settings is astonishingly better than the other phones.
Tile configuration is better
Screen projection (to either tv,, data show or pc)
Battery is just fantastic
Price for a device with all these qualities is a lot lower than Apples and Googles' phones
Micro SD card slot (IOS phones don't have it)
It has the phone jack!!! Yes! You are not obliged to buy an expensive Bluetooth headphone. You CAN CHOOSE TO.

Cons:

Lack of applications that can be somewhat important to some users, like Snapchat and Waze. However, in the case of Waze, I must say Maps application does a better job, except for the traffic information. And lots of games missing. But if you are a gamer, buy a video game!! Don't buy a smart phone full enough with applications to isolate you! Life is good!

I just hope Microsoft opens its eyes and make faster moves in spotting  acquiring good apps. In this sense, all its competition is being faster.

One thing I admire in Microsoft is that it doesn't block its applications for other OSs. I used to use Waze on my phone until Google bought it and dropped the support for Windows users. Nowadays, Microsoft reminds me of John Rockefeller: After being sentenced to sell most of his companies due to monopoly, he kept partnership in most of them and got even richer than ever!!

Okay, the important stuff:  The bumper frame allows you to put your phone face-down with protection.  The buttons are responsive and the back cut-out for the lens and flash are spot-on.  What I noted as above average: the bottom design. The case provides passage for a fairly large headphone jack. The thickest corded headphone jack I have is the brainwavz S1 and it fits fine.

B017TQ5XYK,,3,"There is honestly so much that can be said about Babyface. He honestly has been one of the greatest singer/songwriters in regards to R&B music. Yet, he has been absent from making decent music for quite awhile. He came back from a long absence from making music for himself in regards to good music. He came back with Toni Braxton a few years ago, and they both released Love, Marriage & Divorce, which wasn't a bad record for the two of them. But for himself, he has needed to write better for his solo work. We've Got Love, which is the lead single from his latest album, Return Of The Tender Lover, isn't a bad song for die hard Babyface buffs, but overall not a must download for new fans of his music. The song does show his style nobly but not really anything to thrive into that ""wow, I must own this song"" factor. Still, he has had great songs before, like When Can I See You Again. But overall, there can be better from Babyface down the road.

B002POQ2UQ,,5,"This collection is a real breakthrough for Amazon and the X5 music group, which offers these collections of bargain MP3s of classical music.

Like previous collections, this Vivaldi set puts together a strong roster of lesser-known players, often (but not only) lesser-known ensembles from Eastern Europe who still offer really nice performances.

A huge change, and a tremendously welcome one, is that complete works are offered! Until now, all these sets have just slapped together stray movements of pieces out of order. This one offers cohesive works in their entirety, from beginning to end.

If they could now go back to Beethoven and start over using this Vivaldi set as a model, that would be fantastic.

At the $2.99 ""Deal of the Day"" price on Oct 30, 2009, this is a great bargain. I think it would still be pretty good at the normal price too, and I don't usually say that.

The instrumental tracks are just what you've come to hear from Brain Culbertson all of these years! My favorite instrumental track is ""Madelena"".
  It is mysterious and passionate at the same time.

B003JL70WS,,5,"Everything But The Girl vocalist Tracey Thorn is back with her third solo album ""Love and its opposite"", based she says on real life after the age of 40; Moribund relationships, divorce, getting back on the dating scene, etc. There are no electronic Dance songs like ""Grand canyon"" ""Falling off a log"", or ""It's all true"" this time around which I missed at first, but the songs here are very strong, warm and intimate.

Opening is the gentle piano/string ballad ""Oh, the divorces!"", followed by the acoustic ballad ""Long white dress"" with percussion building in halfway through.

""Hormones"" is sunny Pop/Rock with a light Country feel, followed by the brilliant haunting ballad ""Kentish town"" with lovely harmonies. ""Why does the wind?"" is beautiful Pop/Soul, the type George Michael used to make effortlessly in the eighties. E.g. ""Hand to mouth"".

The tender unadorned ""You are a lover"" is a cover of a song by The Unbending Trees. ""Singles bar"" is midtempo and Country-tinged. The surreal ""Come on home to me"" is a cover of a song by Lee Hazlewood and features additional vocals by Jens Lekman as well as ghostly effects.

""Late in the afternoon"" is the grooviest song here with gentle electronic beats, though still morose sounding, and closing is the swirling and shimmery ballad ""Swimming"". It's like swimming in a sea of voices and cymbals. Beautiful!

B00JH1W452,,3,"When it has came down to what Michael Jackson made into his voice and the way he made dance for so many singers and entertainers was one of a kind. Yet, his passing 5 years ago remains one of the most deviating losses of all time. Still, his music and legacy will live on well. Yet, his cavalcade of unreleased songs just has not been able to deliver and instead feels much weaker in voice and in heart as well. Love Never Felt So Good, the lead song from the upcoming escape album has not been able to deliver. It tries and harkens with a much more Disco-style rhythm. But having Justin Timberlake, one of many whom were inspired by Michael Jackson doesn't actually deliver in on the song. Considering when Michael had his final record Invincible released, Justin was still a part of N'SYNC. I really am not a fan of the song, and if you are new to Michael Jackson's music, you should just consider the songs he had released while he was still alive.

B00LIQLELO,,4,"Picking up where ""Highway 37"" left off, Train keep up their winning streak with ""Picasso Cadillac."" Pleasing pop rock, a variety of styles and Pat Monahan's easy on the ears voice. From a far back place, he cries out ""hey baby"" on the opening ""Cadillac Cadillac,"" like he's vying for your attention, and he keeps it for the album's 12 songs. They also keep the harmonies intact, especially the opening to ""Angel In Blue Jeans,"" which is downright soulful.

There's even some toying with country western, as the typical country topic ""I'm Drinking Tonight"" finds him pining for a lost love. What's the way out? ""The only thing stronger than you is whiskey...poison's the cure."" Reminded me a little of Chris Isaak's high lonesome, just without the falsetto. Speaking of falsettos, Pat gives his some running room on ""Give It All,"" which veers in the direction of Maroon 5. There's plenty of romance and life lessons to go around, especially on the make up song ""Baby, Happy Birthday,"" where a chastened Pat sings his heart out for forgiveness. Or the sweet acoustic ""Don't Grow Up So Fast,"" this time sung as a reminder of parenthood to keep the growing years precious in your hearts.

Still, there's lots of playful and catchy material here. The bubbly duet with Marsha Ambrosius, Wonder What You're Doing For The Rest Of Your Life"" even has the band in giggles at the start. While I think ""Highway 37"" has the edge as the better album, ""Bulletproof Picasso"" mines the veins from party to pathos and keeps the Train comeback ride alive.","09 16, 2014",A3KJ6JAZPH382D,Tim Brough,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},This Train Keeps A'Rollin',1410825600,False,,Digital_Music

B0083WMA4Q,,5,"Earth, Wind & Fire has certainly been IMO the platinum standard for musicianship and vocals!

Hearing this song by Eric Benet certainly brings to mind the EWF classic ""THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD"" ... one would almost swear he either sampled the entire rhythm track from that song or he went out and wholesale commissioned EWF to play on this tune! I had to check the CD's credits to make sure Philip Bailey wasn't listed as a background vocalist, because it sure sounds like him singing ""WEE-DOO-DOO-DOO"" on this track.

On his own merits Eric Benet is a stellar A-List R&B singer with a falsetto range rivaling that of the great Philip Bailey of EWF. Indeed, Benet is a friend and colleague of Maurice White, Philip Bailey and the entire EWF family. If Philip Bailey ever decides to retire from EWF, Benet would fit in nicely as a replacement! He's certainly got the range and the vocal chops to do all the Philip Bailey-led falsetto songs of the EWF playlist ... particularly ""REASONS""! Who else besides Eric Benet could even hope to do justice to that EWF gem? I sure would like to see Eric Benet & EWF on the same show/tour; no matter who opens for whom!

But I digress ...

On this single, Eric Benet does more than just copy or sample the EWF flavor, he takes their whole pot of stew and adds something uniquely all his own ... the recipe really cooks ... and it works!!

It's incredulous that Eric Benet has been nominated 4 times, but has yet to win a Grammy!!

B0012484C4,,3,"This is the third-best song on the Cars second-best album.  It represents Ric Ocasek's peak songwriting capabilities and does provide an opportunity for Eliot Easton to demonstrate his guitar skills.  It has that classic Cars sound--a quirky bridge between rock and new wave

To be clear the three-star rating I give this song is a good rating.  I suppose someone else might give it four stars, but I save four stars for great songs and five stars for songs I simply could not live without (there are only 8 five-star rated songs in my entire music collection.)

If you like the Cars sound and do not own any of the songs on the album ""Candy-O"" then purchase the whole album.  Because I already owned ""Let's Go"" from another compilation, I could not quite justify the cost and bought this individual .mp3 instead.  I own five of the songs on this album:  ""Let's Go"", ""It's All I Can Do"", ""Double Life"", ""Candy-O"" and ""Dangerous Type.""

If you are trying to gauge my review, understand that I tend to prefer the Cars more rock-oriented songs, which are sometimes, but not always their most popular.  ""It's All I Can Do"" is definitely one of their more pop-oriented songs.  It just happens to be one of their better ones.","01 9, 2014",A2BPD1NQI7CE4O,Ted B-man,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},Classic Ric Ocasek/Cars,1389225600,True,,Digital_Music

B004L99MNW,,5,"My old friend from the 1960s great American hitchhike highway, Peter Paul Markin (then consciously carrying the moniker of Be-Bop Benny), really was the first person who tuned me into the world of blues, old time country blues (driven by the Saturday juke joints), and the later post-World War II electrification of the blues as blacks headed north to the cities- and electricity. He got me, a small city Maine boy, hip to the likes of Son House, Skip James, Bessie Smith, Memphis Minnie, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. All unabashedly raw talent, and all out front down deep blues, country or city.

Of course that was over forty years ago and almost all of those who he hipped me too have now passed on, although not their musical influence and that is what brings me to this review, Alligator Records: 40th Anniversary Collection 2 CD set. Since the blues are still very much with us, although that genre, like rock and roll, has it up and down periods of popularity it is necessary to take a peek at who has carried on the traditions that Be-Bop Benny started me out on when we travelled those West Coast highways seeking the great American West night.

And that is where the Alligator Record label comes in. In earlier times certain record companies were known, and well-known, for certain kinds of music. Chess Record sin Chicago comes readily to for electric blues. As does Sun Records for early rock (and rockabilly). And Vanguard Records for folk stuff. Well Alligator has filled a certain niche for those who wished to carry on the electric blues tradition and this 38 performance collection set is testimony to those efforts for the last forty -something years.

While they may have recoded for other recoding companies or had other label arrangements (not uncommon in the helter-skelter world of record production) the artists list here constitute something  of ""who's who"" of post-1960s electric blues. A small roll call of names like Koko Taylor, Albert Collins, Guitar Shorty, Marcia Ball, Son Seal, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Johnny Winter, Lonnie Brooks, Hound Dog Taylor, James Cotton and the rest make my case. The only question that I have is who will produce the next generation of blues material?  Alligator Records efforts here are the new benchmark.","07 2, 2012",AGEIT17HENDIS,Alfred Johnson,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Out In The Be-Bop 1970s Night,1341187200,False,,Digital_Music

B01CT5PHJ2,,5,"I was weary about purchasing this product because of all of those 1-star reviews. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.","07 5, 2017",A3RUNGX8PZ8VYO,Lexus,,7/5/17 - It worked for me (and some tips if you are having issues),1499212800,True,28.0,Gift_Cards

I know there are recipes for making it, but getting the fresh yuzu and proper hot peppers for the correct flavor profile isn't easy in most parts of the US (don't believe the recipes which say you can substitute Jalapeno or serano chiles they are the wrong taste), so these little bottles of this firey salty condiment are a terrific find.  Once open keep it in the refrigerator and use sparingly because they are spicey hot, but you will find all sorts of ways to use it.  The combination of the salt, chile pepper and yuzu juice and rind add a lift the almost anything.  I first ate this where a little dab of it topped a wonderfully fresh raw scallop.  If you don't like raw fish, try a dot of it on a lightly sauteed scallop.  Of course I use it on all sorts of things --eggs are fab with it,  a chicken breast which has been either roasted or sauteed and sliced thin with little dab of yuzu kosho makes it an instant hit.  I don't cook with it, but rather use it as a condiment and sometimes I just crave its hot, bright flavor.

B005F5U00A,,5,"At first when I started using chia seeds regularly, people said to me ""chia seeds are chia seeds.....why do you need to buy a brand?""  I did buy bulk seeds in my health food store....I did buy bags at Trader Joe's...and I still went back to my organic
Salba Seeds and find they work the best for me.  Here's what I do with them.  I take 1 cup of almond milk (or soy, rice or plain old milk if you wish) and add a few soaked dates (which I left in a pot of water which had boiled but turned flame off).  PItted the
dates, threw them (about 4 large ones) into my Vitamix (you can use a blender) and let them blend until totally mixed.  While blender is running, add 1/2 cup of chia seeds (My organic Salba seeds) and a few tsp of cocoa powder and instant coffee (if you like
that flavor).  Let the blender or Vitamix run until everything has thickened.  That's it.  Pour into a container.  Refrigerate.  What have you made?  Chia seed pudding.  Sugar free, lots of fiber, a perfect breakfast.  Some people use a banana instead of dates,
others leave off the cocoa and coffee powder.  IT's a mater of taste and any sweet fruit works as a substitute sweetener. If you eat super low carb, even an artificial sweetener will work instead of fruit....with or without cocoa/coffee.

SO why Salba seeds and not just any chia seeds?  Because this recipe I'm sharing, which I've tried with other chia seeds doesn't seem to work as well or taste as well.  Perhaps it's my imagination, but these seeds seem to be consistently clean, fresh and a blender
or mixer like a Vitamix will pulverize them into a pudding perfectly in less than a minute.

Just a big fan of this product.  I keep buying many jars at a time. I like that it's organic.  And I think any company that focuses on putting their seeds in a jar and branding them probably has higher standards than chia seeds sold in bulk in bins...where I'm
afraid bugs and dirt might have collected.... I always have my high fiber chia seed pudding ready for breakfast and even when I use the last of my pudding up, it's only minutes to make another batch.","10 1, 2012",A2912BA68NPCYG,Marly,,I  Lve my Salba seeds!,1349049600,True,30,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

I know put like that it doesn't seem like an awful lot, but those are very satisfying bites and when combined with a nice cup of hot tea or coffee it makes quite an indulgent feeling snack break.  All the nuts and fruits are combined with the sticky ingredients and compressed into a bite size piece with the bottom being covered by dark chocolate.  Sweeteners contained in the ingredients are:  sugar, raisin juice, honey, brown sugar, brown rice syrup, and  raw cane sugar.  Granted, some of the sweeteners are used in the dried fruits and the crisp rice, but they are still in there.

My association with the brand is little hard bursts of often tart sugary flavor.  Mixing of different colors/flavor profiles resulting in a fun candy experience.

What we have here is something entirely enjoyable, but quite different.  Imagine instead that the material used to make Nerds has instead been used to coat jellybeans, resulting in an initial crunch and burst of sweet tartness, followed by the chewiness and less pronounced taste profile of that sort of candy.

They're not bad, but they're not Nerds.  I suppose this is a good thing though.  Even little Nerds can be hard crunchy little buggers, hard at times on teeth.  I suppose giant versions of the same would be wreaking far too much dental havoc for even Mr. Wonka to sustain.  I don't know that we'll be buying more of these, but we were happy and pleased with the ones we had.  Perhaps they should have been called something different to temper the expectations of Nerds fans.

B01AHK8WUW,,5,"This is one of several dozen look-alike (or identical) sound level meters available at Amazon.  While they may offer different styling and/or custom functions, they all perform a similar task. Well get to that in a second and how well this one does at doing what its supposed to.

You may have read some of the reviews for devices of this type.  They fall into two broad categories  those who praise what a professional device it is and those who turn their noses up at it for being merely a toy.

Lets look at what its supposed to do.  The concept is simple, it has a built-in microphone and it hears the sound around you approximately the way you hear it.  Audio engineers would laugh at that and state that sound level changes with distance so you need to perform complex mathematical equations to know how to measure it.  Thats not the point of this meter. It is designed to measure RELATIVE sound, i.e. you want to know if that loud truck that drives by your house is exceeding the sound of other traffic by 2x, 3x or some other amount.  It may sound loud to your ears but if the truck doesnt exceed what the law permits the driver is in the clear. If not, you may have a case and can request excessive noise violation monitoring by the authorities.

No one expects to buy a $20 device and have it perform like a professional monitoring device that costs thousands of dollars.  Reviews that claim it does, or criticize it because it doesnt aren't much use to you. What is important is does this device live up to its expectation that it will give you an accurate comparison between low, average and high levels of sound (or noise) and give you a rough idea of how much louder one sound is from another.  That it does.

This handheld meter is well put together for its price and easy to use. The display is clear and easy to read and backlit. When I tested it several times in a row from a set distance to measure a sound of a known level the results were consistent each time.  Its sensitivity is tuned toward the lower frequencies like would be expected from loud vehicle exhausts, low-flying airplanes, fireworks, loud party music, etc. That makes it useful for the hobbyist or casual user.  Like any tool, the more you pay the more you expect to get.  I have tested several similar low-cost sound level meters, including this one, that I acquired as evaluation samples for my tech blog (we do not give preferential treatment to vendors who provide free or discounted samples) and so far this is my favorite in terms of value for the asking price.

It you keep your expectations realistic I believe this is one worth considering.","01 19, 2016",A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,PhotoGraphics,{'Pattern:': ' GM1352'},Lives up to the sellers claims,1453161600,False,16,Industrial_and_Scientific

This tape is AWESOME---sticks to the mat and is pretty easy to pull off the 2nd side of the tape also.  The rug no longer moves which prevents the cats from playing with it and it holds so well it won't slip even when I walk on it.  The corners are firmly in place and that says a  lot with 3 cats who have tried to move it.  This is truly a problem solver and would recommend to anyone!!

Unfortunately I did not realize at the time the significant difference between the Type I (with a plastic funnel) and Type II (with a metal flexible funnel).  For refilling a vehicle, I should have got the Type II because, as one reviewer noted, the plastic funnel does not allow sufficient angle when trying to pour horizontally into a vehicle's gas tank.

B005ZQ47AS,,4,"Probably the nicest Geiger counters you can get for the price. Acquisition is fairly slow and the interface is a tad clunky, but it is not difficult to figure it all out. The styling is cheap, but then, it's not exactly a fashion accessory. It is not particularly rugged, so you don't want to drop it on the ground or expose it to elements.

But before you buy, make sure that the upper range of the unit (9.99 uSv/h) fits your intended use. If you are interested in testing foods and detecting other weak sources of radiation, it may fit the bill. On the flip side, if you are buying it to be able to assess the consequences of a major nuclear accident nearby, you may find it the device to be inadequate, since it maxes out at a level that can be still pretty safe for extended periods of time.

B001J5BEQY,,4,"Lascar EL-USB-2-LCD Humidity, Temperature and Dew Point USB Data logger works well enough for our purposes. We needed a way to track temp and humidity in several rooms that contain electronics and computer equipment, including a machine room with a rack full of fiber channel RAID drives. Press the button on the data logger and the LCD displays the current temperature. Consecutive button presses display the current humidity, highest temperature, lowest temperature, highest humidity and lowest humidity. That part is easy and works well for the session (hours, days, etc.) while you are logging data in one area.

Lascar uses EasyLog software that works with Windows only. We use Macs, so we run their software in a Windows 7 virtual machine on the Mac using VMware Fusion 4. EasyLog is not very full-featured, and it lacks some features we wish it had. Before you can use the data logger, you must first connect it to your computer and set preferences in the software.

Once setup is finished, unplug the USB and place it in the room of your choice to begin logging. When you are ready to stop logging, plug the USB into the computer and launch EasyLog again. You will be able to save the file for later reference, or you can export to Excel, but you must have Excel installed, or the software will not allow you to save an XLS file. This is a disadvantage for anyone who does not have Excel on their PC, but who would like to export an XLS file for use elsewhere, such as on their Mac or another PC.

The EasyLog software generates a chart that graphs temperature, humidity, and dew point, each in a different color, over the span of time logged by the device. As you move your cursor across the graph, a tiny readout at the bottom of the chart displays values in whole numbers. You can zoom in to get more detail on any part of the graph.

There is no provision for saving a screenshot or a PDF of the graph or a zoomed section of it. The native file can only be read by EasyLog. You can print a copy of the graph, but I'd prefer to save a PDF (not an option in their software). The previously mentioned ability to export to Excel is the only other option.

Since the LCD can display highest and lowest values, you might think the EasyLog chart would display the peaks, but it does not. You can mouse around looking for them, but a print out does not list them. A chart of a day or more will not be granular enough for you to accurately determine values in a print out.

By the way, once you've connected the wand to the computer and started the software, the data will be erased from the wand. We try to remember to manually record peak values from the LCD before connecting to the PC. When you're finished saving the graph in EasyLog, you might think you could just unplug the device and be ready to start your next logging session, but you'd be wrong. Before you can begin a new session of logging data, you must step through several screens of the software's setup menu again and answer the same questions each time. EasyLog does not remember all of your preferences from session to session. For example, we like to start the logging session when the single button on the wand is pressed, but we have to select this option each time since it is not remembered. Even though we never set ""alarms"" we still have go go through that part of the preferences each time. The software is a little dumb, but I like the device, so I took off one star for the software's maddening limitations.

This last point may be a plus for left-handed users, but right-handed users will notice the LCD display is upside down if you hold the wand in your right hand. Oh, well. I guess you can please some of the people some of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.","06 29, 2012",A2XZSIQRD3Q6GF,Summer,,Lefties - This One's For You,1340928000,True,,Industrial_and_Scientific

As well as formulated my own after extensive study in cosmetic chemistry, herbalist, formulation and clinical aromatherapy.

After trying for a week, I didn't notice much difference.  Just a few notes about some ingredients, many of which can be found in most face moisturizers.

Moisturizes / hydrates / protects due to the Glyceryl Linolenate, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Glycerin, Shea butter, and Mango butter)

Goes on smooth and skin conditioning and (Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Oleanolic Acid, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, sage and rosemary leaf extracts)

Slightly fragrant (mainly due to Fragrance Parfum, Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, and Geraniol)

Use of Artemia Extract (zooplankton-extracted from brine shrimp), is becoming popular for anti-aging creams. First, its animal based. Second, used to protect skin from extreme thermal stress like cold temperatures or UV Rays. Third, there is really little to no information on it other than it appears to be in a few luxury products.

Most of the other ingredients include emulsifiers, preservatives, chelating agents, antioxidants, anti-aging, etc.

Now, about the use of parabens, I would expect given the trend of moving away from these types of preservatives that a product of this price and quality would approach a more main stream stance of replacing them.

Just a bit odd for me that the ingredients on the box don't match what is on the website. For example, the box states it contains Methylparaben, butylparaben and proxypaparben while the website states Methylparaben and Ethylparaben.

Over, its a very nice moisturizer and hydrating facial cream, but at the price point of $365 for 1.7oz, it is very over priced compared to other facial creams and ingredients in the luxury category. And the environmental working group database did not give it high marks due to use of ingredtnts such as Fragrance, Triethanolamine, BHT, Polyacrylamide, Phenoxyethanol, and Methylparaben.","05 4, 2018",ARTHSLN5BW5PW,Parker-Moore Family,,"Decent moisturizer, animal based ingredient, use of paranens, overpriced",1525392000,False,,Luxury_Beauty

There are two negatives for me.

- First, the current price of $56.00 is expensive. Previously, I purchased two $55 SPF face creams in the past and I paid the high price because I could use it on my entire face, including my eyelids. This product requires you avoid the eyes and also avoid any broken skin. If I could use this in the eye area as well, then I would not balk about the price.

- Second, I do not like the pump tube because it takes a lot of pumping action to dispense the necessary amount of product. Also, I always feel there is wasted product left behind once I get to the end.

It comes in a very masculine looking can, which may or may not matter to you. However, even the most manly man won't mind having this out on his bathroom counter.

The hairspray itself is what I would call a light hold. Spray it once and your hair won't be stiff and it will be held in place for the day in indoor conditions. You'll need to spray it again and maybe even 3 times to get the kind of hold that will stand up to windy conditions and even then, this won't give you unmovable helmet hair. Since my guys prefer a light hold, this is great for them. And all of the men in my family really like the smell.

I suppose a woman could also use it but the scent is decidedly masculine. I'm focusing on the scent because that is really the only reason to pay this much for a can of hairspray.

It absorbs really fast, and after a minute or two you feel the tingling/burning sensation on your skin--for my wife it was about a 5 minute long sensation. Obviously different skin types may react differently, but it doesn't leave her skin red like some other treatments. She has tried using 10% creams in the past, but they are too strong and cause a bad skin reaction and redness. This 5% mixture is the right balance for her skin. Compared to other benzoyl peroxide acne treatments, this does not dry your skin that much, but still is effective at reducing the acne. It gave noticeable results and clearer skin after just 1 week. The downside of this cream, like others, is that it increases your sun sensitivity, so you may need to take extra precautions to protect your skin. Of all the acne treatments my wife has used (at least a half dozen brands), this is the most effective she's used yet. However, if she stopped using it for a day or two, the skin condition regressed. But she was extremely satisfied with the results. A minor caution while using benzoyl peroxide treatments, they can discolor fabrics, like pillow-cases, so use a cheap one!

B01D3ESU88,,4,"Meaningful Beauty Wrinkle Smoothing Capsules contain a white, silky serum that's supposed to improve the appearance of facial expression lines. I'm in my 50's and have sensitive skin that tends to get really dry. I apply this serum all over my face and neck, but I first concentrate on problem areas on my forehead and around my eyes and mouth. This serum isn't greasy and my skin absorbs it quickly. I apply my face cream after (like I do after applying any face serum) and then apply my makeup with no issues. The biggest benefit so far is that this serum makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.

This serum adds some hydration but isn't as soothing or hydrating for my dry skin as my favorite serums. I don't notice any immediate plumping or improvement in the appearance of my fine lines. Still, this product has a pleasing feel and nice attributes- it's non irritating, has no added fragrance (hard to find) and no parabens (a controversial preservative). It also has ingredients that sound good quality like melon fruit extract, olive oil, jojoba seed extract, sunflower seed oil and more. I like this serum enough to use all 60 capsules and see if I notice any visible improvement in the long term.

I really like the capsule delivery system. I find them easy to gently twist open and squeeze to get all the product so none is wasted. The product is fresh and free of bacteria that gets into a product from dipping into a container with a finger (as most of us probably don't use a spatula). Plus, the product is pre measured and is the perfect amount for one application. I also like knowing how many applications are left-a guessing game with a serum pump. In short, I like the capsules, the serum quality and how smooth the product makes my skin feel. So far, it doesn't seem quite hydrating enough for my dry skin-but it is likely to suit those with less dry skin. I'm hoping for some longer term benefits, but can't judge them until I use all 60 capsules. I'll update as appropriate.","01 1, 2017",A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,Robin,,Good Quality Serum That's Non Irritating To My Dry Sensitive Skin And Makes My Skin Feel Soft But Not As Hydrated As I Like,1483228800,False,4.0,Luxury_Beauty
B00J9JOV9O,,4,"This does a nice job minimizing the occasional dark circles under my eyes. It blends and absorbs easily and is gentle on my sensitive skin. There is no greasy feeling and it stays in place all day. It has a flexible applicator that makes it easy to get the cream under my eyes, but I haven't been able to use it to blend it in all the way and still resort to finishing it off using my fingers.

I don't see much in the way of anti-aging as there are still fine lines in my skin.

First, it is worth noting that this is sunscreen, not just lotion that happens to have SPF in it.  I say this because the name initially threw me off since it is called moisturizer and not sunscreen.  But from reading the packing and applying it is definitely sunscreen.  I say this because I regularly buy both and while lotion with SPF is my go-to on a day to day basis it's usually not waterproof enough or applied in a large enough quantity to provide adequate protection if you're wearing a bathing suit.

First, I'll start with what I like about the product.  I like that it is waterproof for 80 minutes.  I also like that it is natural.

That said, I'm not sure this product is meant for my needs.  First, it has a very pungent smell.  Admittedly, I tend to be sensitive to smells so if you are not, you may find yourself less bothered by the scent.  But I had my boyfriend, who is less sensitive to smells than I am, try it and he too found the smell strong and unpleasant.  It reminded me a lot of household cleaner, which I wasn't expecting since the other Juice Beauty product I've used has no scent at all.  It also seems to sting my sensitive skin a bit.  I wasn't expecting that because again, I've really liked the other Juice Beauty product I tried.

It's also quite thick.  I got this with the intention of using it on my face, but it feels too heavy.  It also gives no indication of whether it is appropriate for acne prone skin so I'm a bit nervous it could clog my pores.  Because of that, it seems more appropriate for my body, though functionally I have an easier time applying sunscreen with a spray.

Based on my experience, this just isn't the sunscreen for me.

B00IMJF09M,,5,"Yes, this product is heavily-scented.  But it is like my favorite scent of all time (benzaldehyde, which is the component you will find in many almond and cherry scents and flavors).  So I am happy to slather it all over my body.  For what it's worth, the scent doesn't last a super long time.

More to the point, this is an effective product.  As a light oil, I have found it to work well in place of a body serum.  I apply it to towel-dried arms and legs and my skin is so soft and smooth after using this for awhile.  (I often do follow up with other products designed for specific purposes -- tightening, moisturizing, KP treatment, etc.  It is compatible with everything I've put over it so far.)  It absorbs into the skin without actually leaving the skin oily.  I don't think my body skin is particularly dry or particularly oily, compared to my face, but this is nicely hydrating either way.

To me, this is a lighter type of oil (especially since it can be sprayed rather than coming in a dropper or pump).  I am of two minds on the spray nozzle.  On the one hand, you can control the amount dispensed quite well with the pump, and I appreciate not getting too much (which would lead to product waste).  On the other hand, the pump is kind of hard to depress, so I usually just dispense this into my hands and apply it (as opposed to spraying directly on the body).  It spreads reasonably well (and does a little better as it warms up to body temperature).

Here is the ingredients list (it is in one of the product images but that is kind of hard to read):

Sweet Almond Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Oleyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Camelina Sativa Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Dioleyl Tocopheryl Methylsilanol, Limonene, Coumarin, Linalool, Citral.

Also, this will contain some residual almond proteins so you may want to avoid if you have a tree nut allergy.

I have mocha colored skin and rule of thumb is that you are suppose to choose at least one or two shades lighter when purchasing a concealer.  This way you can neutralize dark areas without having unwanted attention because it is way too light.  I am using the Medium Neutral Cool.

Concealers are for spot correctors and not to be used as an all over foundation substitute.  It should always be worn underneath foundation and powers. You can apply it with your finger or use a small brush.

The em michelle brand feels very velvety smooth and dries up to a satin powdery finish.  However, I found that it only looked smooth under my eyes, while areas where there are wrinkles and fine lines it looked caked on and very noticeable.  My dark circles did appear quick a bit lighter and my skin even looked smoother under my eyes.  However areas that I did spot covering for blemishes and acne dark spots did not look as smooth.

B00LIXT0M2,,3,"I have one huge, huge warning for you: if your skin is especially sensitive then you may want to exercise extreme caution with this mask. My skin isn't overwhelmingly sensitive, but it is sensitive enough to where my face did burn and get a little red after I removed the mask so I don't think that this will be something I do on a weekly basis. I would chalk this up to the glycolic acid, I suppose. My skin's just a little weird in how it reacts to new cosmetics. I do want to note that it did get better after patting the skin down a little and applying a little lotion.

However does it work?

Well, I can't really give you a complete answer for this because this is the sort of thing that would be best judged over a long period of time and I'm not honestly sure if I'll do this on a regular enough basis to where I'd see overwhelming differences for my skin. I'm someone who has always had problem pores and that's why I selected this from Amazon Vine, so that was the first thing I looked for when I took the mask off. It may be me hoping that my pores were smaller, but they didn't look as big as they did beforehand. I didn't see an overwhelmingly huge difference, but that may be something I'd see over time. My skin did feel a little softer afterwards as well. I can't honestly give any huge description on its anti-aging claims since I'm right on the cusp of starting to show my age, so I don't have any overwhelmingly visible age lines yet. They're there, but small- I can mostly thank my father's genes for that, though.

So is this worth it ? It looks like it does a pretty good job. The price for this would be a little daunting for me if I were to buy it with my own money, but I do have to say that a little bit goes a very, very long way. For my first mask I was able to pretty much just use the mask clay that was on the top of the jar lid. My only big gripe so far (other than the slight irritation for my skin) was how messy this can be when it comes to removing it. I definitely recommend using the old washcloths for this one, since it does leave somewhat of a stain on the cloth even if you constantly rinse it out.

I really want to give this a higher rating, but I just can't get past the burning irritated feeling that this left on my skin. I'm just not sure that this is really right for people with sensitive skin like mine.

I have blonde hair, and anything too heavy also makes it seem dirty or appear to have buildup or oil faster -- that isn't a problem with this conditioner.

The pump works very well, only problem is that it may take slightly longer if you use a lot of conditioner -- not because it clogs, just because it ""rises"" after a pump relatively slowly.  Although, usually the ones that rise up quickly end up with large air pockets inside the bottle, so they're not much faster in the long run.

Overall, a very nice, rich feeling conditioner that makes my hair soft and well conditioned, but not weighed down.  Not an overly fruity scent, but clean and light.","06 29, 2017",A141W8WHW9AC3H,Robin,,"Rich without buildup, clean scent",1498694400,False,,Luxury_Beauty

So far, this brush has been the best of the bunch.

My hair has gone from long, brushing my waist to it's current super short above the neck lengh.  When my hair is past my neck it needs help with volume because it doesn't matter what styling gel I use it flattens out to super straight.  but now that my hair is short, I wasn't sure how I was going to test out this brush.  I usually just blast it with a blow dryer for about 3 minutes and the slight wave and cowlicks are tamed.  Hairstyle achieved.

But I was surprised to find that even short hair like mine could benefit from this brush.  I used the brush on damp hair to creat a cute little hair flip.  The next day, I styled it against the part and then combed it back for maximum  volume to create a puffier, glamour look.

I wouldn't say the styling options are endless, the  longest part of my hair is about a 1/4 inch past my earlobe, so it's limited.  But I like how sleek and shiny my hair looks after using this brush, even if I haven't conditioned my hair for weeks it looks glossy and mirrorlike.

Also worth noting is the cord.  My last two styling brushes had wear on the cord, they broke down and had to be tossed out way earlier than I would like.  But this styling brush has a hardened cover over the first couple of inches of cord, right where the cord gets the most wear and tear.  Problem solved.

I was looking for a solution that would help me tame the wyld beast.  Currently I use Schwarzkopf's Got2B Glued, essentially Elmer's Glue for the hair.

So a little about Baxters. The name is for Bxter Finley, who invested Super Shape in 1965 and, with that success, went into all kinds of products for men: toner, creams, soaps and shaving creams.

My first experience with this Pomade was not positive. It didn't turn my hair orange, or make it stick straight out.  Instead, it simply vanished.  I put it on, rubbed it in and that was it.  No hold that I could tell, no shine, just simple disappearance.  The second time, I used more and saw some shine (or thought I did).  The third time, I mixed it with my normal gel (Got2be...) and that did the trick.  I had the hold and the shine came out.  In short, it looked good.

Its possible that different hair types will have different reactions or results. Simply, your mileage may vary.

It comes out thick and one pump covers my face. A second pump covers my neck and chest. It immediately soaks in but leaves a thin, light feeling, non-greasy layer on the skin and feels like a protectant. The directions state morning and night or at least once a day. For me in these summer months I was NOT able to use it in the morning as it was just too thick for me to use this serum PLUS an SPF 46 facial product to protect my skin against sunburn and as a skin cancer preventative. I live in hot and humid Houston Texas which has strong sun and requires such a sunscreen every day. So, I used SkinMedica HA5 serum before bed. I have been trying different SkinMedica products for the last 4.5 months once or twice a day and have definately noticed a big change. I no longer get patches of dry skin, I have been getting less pimples (related to hormones or clogged pores) and less associated skin peeling from adult acne. I feel the fine lines and wrinkles which have begun to appear on my face are staring to erase away. Per directions this does not go in the eye area so the little crow's feet are still there.

B00JRW7QCC,,5,"I've been using this for six months now, and wanted to wait that long to write a review to make sure that this works.  I originally splurged (thanks to a great coupon on Sephora) on the regular-sized device, along with the ELE eye and lip enhancer and the laser adaptors, but only used them twice before returning the set and getting the NuFace Mini from Amazon.  While I saw results when I used the regular NuFace after each session, I decided to exchange it for the Mini since I quickly realized that the Mini would allow me to do almost everything that I had been hoping that the ELE attachment would enable me to do.

As a bit of background, I'm a few months shy of 45, and, while I think my skin looks decent overall because I've been using Retin-A for about fifteen years, I do have some slackness to my face and my crows' feet have been getting more pronounced.  I don't have any desire to get injections, so this seemed like a good alternative, and it has been so far.  While it hasn't done any miracles on my face, my crows' feet do seem improved, and my skin looks tighter.  It hasn't made much of a difference in my naso-labial folds, and I really had been hoping it would.

When I used it the first time, the ELE adaptor left a huge indentation along my left-hand smile line that took 48 hours (!!!) to fully go away.  I was following along with the video when this happened, and have to say that it really freaked me out.  Even my husband noticed and asked me what was going on.  When I contacted the company, they said that they couldn't really advise me what to do, but, as I said, it did go away.  After that, I decided to return the large NuFace since using the ELE attachment again made me nervous, and that's when I bought this Mini.

The way that this works is that you use it in sweeping motions and in certain held positions until it beeps at you after five seconds.  In the places where you sweep, you pass it over three areas, three times each, in a certain pattern.

Because this was such a large expense for me, I read a ton of reviews on various websites before buying the regular NuFace and then the Mini, and here are some things to know before you buy:

--Realize that this does take a time commitment.  When you first get it, you're supposed to use it six days a week for the first two months, and after that you can cut back to a few times a week.  You only need to use it five minutes a day, but you can add on a few extra holds in other areas of your face, which is what I have been doing since I got it back in November.  Even doing that, a treatment session takes about fifteen minutes, which is much better for lazy me than the twenty to thirty minutes that using the two other attachments (the ELE and laser) would take.  I know that Im lazy about the extra commitment that using the ELE and laser attachments would require, so, for me, the Mini seemed like a better option.

--I definitely taste a metallic taste after using this along my jawline and near my mouth.  It goes away after about an hour, but is still a bit unsettling at first.

--Other reviewers are correct that the gel that this comes with is pretty awful.  It dries right away, and if its not wet, youll have to keep applying it or you will feel a sting.  I ended up buying some aloe vera gel, but it didn't work that well and I had red marks on my face.  I decided to get some ultrasound gel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spectra-360-Electrode-Gel-Parker-Laboratories-8-5-oz-Tube-Pack-of-2/dp/B0093J2GM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spectra 360 Electrode Gel - Parker Laboratories - 8.5 oz Tube - (Pack of 2)</a>), and it works perfectly.

--Speaking of the sting, if you do notice this, use more gel and those stings will go away.  I also had some red streaks the first time I used this since I hadnt realized that I needed to re-apply the gel since it dried up really quickly on my first pass of the device.

--When you get the device, the instruction manual will include a link to a NuFace site with some videos on how to use this device properly.  I followed along a few times, then I placed the printed out instructions in a sheet protector so I could keep it on hand for reference and not be worried about water dripping on it (a lesson learned the hard way).

--The company also has a free app you can download to your smartphone that will walk you through using it and also give you reminders.

--Im on the smaller side with a long, narrow face, so the regular NuFaces balls felt almost too large to get in smaller places like under my eyebrows and above my lips.  The Mini glides along my face and is easier to use for me.

--I had really wanted the light attachment, but it sends out constant pulses of light, and that made it a challenge for me to use since it hurt my eyes while using it.  I know you can wear goggles while using that attachment to avoid the annoyance, but the flashing light around my eyes would still be present when using it on those areas.

--Expect for your face to hurt a bit after you first start using this.  I haven't experienced any bruising, but the soreness I felt  in my face is similar to that I feel after lifting weights, when the muscle feels fatigued.  That feeling lasted about two months, but I now no longer notice it.

Overall, I'm pleased with this little device.  If you get into a regular habit of using it, it makes a difference, and it's a nice way to make your skin look more refreshed and toned.","05 31, 2016",A2V5R832QCSOMX,Leanne,{'Style:': ' NuFACE mini Facial Toning Device Set'},"Makes a subtle difference, and has helped me with crows' feet",1464652800,True,336.0,Luxury_Beauty
B002QG6P9G,,5,"This is a great protein free mask that will cure dry hair completely.  It's really hydrating and leaves my hair soft, shiny and feeling very healthy.  I use it for about an hour with heat and it works like a charm.  It's super thick and rich and it makes my hair very smooth.  It also smells amazing.  It's very thick so a little bit goes a long way.  I've also used it overnight and it works just as well that way.  If you have dry hair, this is the perfect remedy.  Although it's very moisturizing, it's not heavy and my hair is still bouncy and full of body afterward.  I use it about once every two weeks, even once a month, and it keeps my hair in great condition.  I also use the Agadir moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, which are really great and super nourishing.  These three products have cured my dry hair completely.  I no longer have a fuzzy halo but now have very smooth, silky strands instead.  Although this product does contain some silicone, it's the water soluble type and there's no build up or residue.  They do help with the smoothness and don't seem to interfere with the hydration.  This is by far the best moisturizing mask I've ever used and I recommend it for anyone with dry hair.  You can also use it in place of regular conditioner if your hair needs extra attention.  It will work well in 15-20 minutes if you decide to use it this way.  I think Agadir products are much better than Moroccan Oil and are much more reasonably priced on Amazon.  My stylist charges $40 for the mask and $20 apiece for the shampoo and conditioner.  I also use the Agadir serum which eliminates frizz completely and adds healthy shine and also protects really well against heated styling tools.  The serum is $40 in the salon but is $15 on Amazon so my stylist is definitely not getting my $$, lol!  Right now, I'm loving all of these Agadir products and am thinking about trying the volumizing shampoo and conditioner, which my girlfriend uses and loves.  I'm definitely telling all my friends about this great brand.  The results have been nothing short of miraculous for me.","11 18, 2015",A26JQI6AC1C588,G Jones,{'Size:': ' 8 oz'},Awesomely wonderful.,1447804800,False,,Luxury_Beauty

Other than its high price point ( at this time ) its instructions state not to light over two hours at a time... I am a candle burner.. I come home, relax, open a bottle of wine and light a candle or two.. Usually for more than two hours more like around four  .. So the idea that this candle should only be burnt for two hours was a little strange but its a high fragrance candle, and the fragrance will probably be overpowering or too strong if lit longer?

I followed the instructions and I guess the instructions are true.. After the timer went off my living room was nicely fragrant with a tea-e flower scent.. Lighting for three hours would be too much, although when I blew the candle out the smell slowly went away..  For the next couple nights I lit the candle again for two hours, and the same effect my living room smells great ..

So my final conclusion is this candle is as intended.. It smells great at the moment, and does fill the room up with a very fragrant unique scent that I would expect to find at a high end retailer or fancy decorated home..  The candle should last for 55 hours, that is almost a month of daily lighting if I want the ambiance this candle creates.  I gave it four stars to start, but realized its a pretty strong smelling candle and although priced high its most likely worth it to the market that can afford it .","09 11, 2015",A3094EPI56GKZ6,Kristen B,{'Scent:': ' Vernissage'},Extremely Fragrant Nice Smelling Candle,1441929600,False,2.0,Luxury_Beauty

B00JH1SYZQ,,3,"When it comes to keeping skin youthful and perhaps even reversing sun damage, people are willing to pay almost any amount for something that is effective and there are no shortage of offerings. While many exotic ingredients and claims are routinely made, to my knowledge, only 2 ingredients have been clinically proven to reverse topical damage and even stimulate collagen production. One of those is Vitamin C, featured in this serum. (The other is Vitamin A based derivatives.) Opinions vary, but a 15% concentration seems to be optimal, though this product does not provide the concentration. I like very much how silky it feels and readily is absorbed into the skin. I used it exclusively for a few weeks to avoid ambiguity as to which product might be effecting a benefit and after several weeks can say that it has provided slow and subtle, but noticeable effects, most notably lightening imperfections and sun spots. I believe it is best applied perhaps twice a day as I did. Why then only 3 stars? It's a matter of value. There are other offerings that perhaps provide a better value at over half the price of this Citrix. That's a matter of experimenting to separate the wheat from the chaff, and can be tricky because Vitamin C is very delicate and is rendered inert and ineffective if exposed to light and oxygen. So depending on the processing and precautions of the manufacturer, two products with identical formulations can have drastically different results if one product is not protected or is warehoused too long and in harsh conditions. Having observed results I can recommend this serum. Though the cost seems a bit excessive, perhaps it might be due to more meticulous handling and fresher ingredients. Recommended but at a cost, especially considering the minimal cost of pharmaceutical grade l-asorbic acid.. Experimenting encouraged.","11 9, 2017",A1VS1LL905P5L5,Hyytekk,,Vitamin C is one of only 2 ingredients clinically proven to revitalize skin and stimulate collagen production.,1510185600,False,,Luxury_Beauty

But those I keep at home. For my office job, I needed something handy to tame my wild knots during winter, the season in which I cover my top-mane with a beanie to fend off the harsh elements. Doing so leaves my hair a tangled mess all over again, so morning visits to the restroom to comb my hair and moustache were necessary.

I used to use a cheap black comb that came with a trimmer set, but it often left my scalp irritated when my hair was short and did nothing when my hair was long (except for pulling on knotted ends). My hair demanded something better, so I thought I'd get a quality comb and see if any difference can be made.

Sure enough, this tortoise shell pocket comb is perfect to keep in my desk drawer. The quality is outstanding, though I say that from upgrading a cheap plastic comb that's probably worth less than $0.50. The teeth are thicker but round, so it glides through my hair easily.

I've been using it as directed morning and at bedtime for about a month and have had no negative reactions or results at all. Unfortunately, I have not been able to discern any positive results on my face either. I have some dry spots on the backs of both hands and occasionally apply a dab to those before applying a heavy moisturizer cream to my hands. I have seen an improvement there, but not on my face. It does make my skin feel soft and clean, but so does my much-cheaper aloe vera moisturizer (which I have continued to apply once the toner dries on my face and neck). Results might be more dramatic using several Obagi products together, but they are expensive. I like the product and the fact that most of the ingredients are natural. The scent is mild and dissipates when the toner dries. I have not noticed any tingling sensation on my skin when the product is applied. I have no complaints except that I don't see much in the way of results on my face.
UPDATE: Since I wasn't seeing much improvement on my facial skin, I decided to try using this product on the backs of my hands. I have had very red, itchy blotches on the backs of both hands for a few years now, and they have been getting redder and itchier. I have tried many creams and moisturizers with little improvement, but I'm finding that by dabbing the Obagi product on those areas in the morning and the evening, the redness has been greatly reduced, the itching has stopped, and the ugly dry areas are smoothing out. I'm VERY impressed and will continue to use this product on my hands. Although the bottle is expensive, by just using it in small areas, it will last a very long time.","02 20, 2017",AF74UAKV3Q3W0,Kathy Parsons,,Updated Review 2/28/17,1487548800,False,2.0,Luxury_Beauty
B000Z61PR6,,3,"I kind of went on a Baxter shopping spree and purchased almost their complete line of products, this included. I never used to use face cream or moisturizer, but after trying this the first time, I may continue to do so. This made my face really smooth and soft, without feeling oily. Has a pleasant smell too. It is a little pricey, but I think it will last a long time. I am very happy with Baxter products.

-Update- I have used this for over one month and I don't think I even notice a difference. It definitely feels nice and smooth while it is on my face, but after I wash it off in the morning, I see no difference. I have actually broken out in a few places on my face and am not sure if it is from this. I will not buy again, too expensive for the lack of results.","02 27, 2014",AZWXG6KBXXC2N,JG,,"Feels smooth while it is on, not after",1393459200,True,7.0,Luxury_Beauty

B00005N7S2,,1,"I subscribe to many outdoor themed magazines and have to say that I have never seen a magazine take such a dive in quality as quickly and drastically as this.  Gone are the great tales of survival and adventure (except in one issue per year).  Instead the magazine is filled with dozens of glossy photos of males modeling overpriced clothing.  Add to this the sheer volume of advertisements and you have very little left for stories or expeditions.  Most of the travel notes are for places that cost terribly much money and would be better represented in Conde Naste or National Geographic Traveler.

For true outdoor enthusiasts I recommend Runners World (it is geared towards running but does feature some great product reviews), Trail Running, and National Geographic Adventure.  Outside magazine is obviously a marketing outlet and I am sure they make big income from the obviously biased product reviews and destination write ups.  I understand this is how the world works... but I will find other sources for my outdoor fix... such as actually going outdoors.  This is not the magazine for true outdoor enthusiasts, but for those who want to dream about buying the gear and never actually using it.

Update:

So I'm not on an auto renewal plan or anything, but I have been getting this magazine for about 3 years now... and it's followed me to my new apartment without me submitting a new address! (Seriously, they are printing my new address - not the post office stickers!).  I think that maybe because I don't really want the magazine, some karmic force out there is punishing me with free issues!  At least my apartment workout room is getting some literature, because it goes from my mailbox, right into the magazine holder there.","01 27, 2011",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,Christopher Barrett,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},Seriously... change the name to 'GQ Rugged Version',1296086400,False,12.0,Magazine_Subscriptions

Gone are the extended articles on training, on doing your own repairs, touring, selecting components, profiles of racers and industry personalities. What's left is a slim magazine containing mostly ads disguised as articles, and justifications for buying disposable $10,000 carbon bike. The bulk of each issue is padded out with very short feature articles telling you things like wide tires are better than narrow ones for gravel,  how to signal turns with your arms, and that when you wash your bike, you shouldn't neglect the underside of the saddle.

Other than tv, ""Bon Appetit"" is one of my main sources I refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. I have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. I have to admit I don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that I read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find.  These recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed.

After receiving my first issue I was very pleased that I ordered this title; having live 30 minutes from Manhattan most of my life and now residing in the high desert plains, this is defintely my Zsa-Zsa/Green Acres fix for the month!

I like how they always apply the fashion trends for women of any age - 20's to 70's.

This issue had generous articles about Patti Hansen and Madonna - whether you care for them or not I think they are real legends as opposed to the various Kardashians that always seem to be on every other cover these days. They do give a nod to up-and-comers by including features like the one with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

I don't mind the many ads since they keep the publishing costs low.

A little talk of everything current - art, movies, books and of course the fashion....

While it is mostly high end couture that is beyond my budget, it is beautifully photographed and the trends are a treat to admire - I think of this as sort of long distance window shopping.","01 10, 2012",A33AQPJYH7UUXR,Desert Gypsy,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},haute and delicious,1326153600,True,9.0,Magazine_Subscriptions

B00005Q7E7,,5,"Bird Watchers Digest is in my opinion a must have magazine for anyone that has any interest in birds.  From the backyard feeder to the world traveler observer, BWD has enough content in all areas to satisfy anyones particular interest, on any level.  There is even a regular section in each issue dedicated to back yard birding.  It isn't a magazine that is at all snobby and considers back yard novices peasants.  On the other hand, it is also a very technical and educational periodical for those that are advanced enough to actually take advantage of the many world wide travel suggestions and deals that are offered throughout the book. I first picked up some BWD back issues on Ebay and enjoyed it enough to order a regular subscription.  I was particularly impressed by its compact size, similar to Readers Digest.  It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library. The only caution that I would suggest to anyone that decides to buy a subscription is to pass on the offer of the digest newsletter that you can subscribe too for every other month that BWD isn't offered.  At $16 a for 6 issues it is not worth it at all.  Its a very thin, (about 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that has as many ads in it as helpful info.  Its a rip off in all honesty. I let my own subscription to it lapse after the first year.  You are much better off subscribing to the BWD email that is sent out periodically that is free, and loaded with article highlights and helpful info.  Overall I highly recommend BWD for all bird enthusiasts on all levels.

B000FTJ7JQ,,5,"Spa Parties and T-shirts that say ""Delish"" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.

The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.

Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.

What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.

This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).

What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.

If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.

Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of ""scientists""  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these ""Chicken Little"" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts? We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or ""Global Warming"".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to ""sustainable"" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of ""greenies"" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates. SA has drunk the Kool-Aid and are now mixing up and distributing batch after batch each month. Who believes that man can ""fix"" the weather or environment?

B00007AWME,,4,"Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.

Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.

I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.

Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.","10 29, 2008",A3JPFWKS83R49V,Bryan Carey,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},Can't Curb Your Enthusiasm?

B00008RUJP,,5,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.

You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.

VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)

Under new editor Dara Caponigro's vision, VERANDA magazine sings and soars.","04 8, 2011",A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,L. M. Keefer,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},VERANDA Virtuosity!,1302220800,True,7.0,Magazine_Subscriptions

B00005N7SM,,5,"Seventeen has been around for 60 years, and tons of teenagers have grown up with it. Recently, Seventeen got a new look and feel, with more mature articles and interesting features for older teeens. Seventeen is good for those teens who feel like they've outgrown other teen magazines but want one that will guide them through college and beyond.
Seventeen features many stuff that teens like to read about- the latest celebrity news, CD and movie release dates, fashion and beauty tips, love and romance, real-life stories, fun stuff to do, and more. As an added bonus, Seventeen covers more worldwide issues then other teen magazines and gives them to you from a teen's point of view. Seventeen also gives you plenty of college and sex advice, which older readers will connect with.
What I love about Seventeen is not only the plentiful amounts of news and real-life stories, but also that it features many bargain items in the Fashion section that are awesome and affordable. Seventeen is a wonderful magazine for bargain shopppers- it features plenty of clothes, make-up, hair products, and jewelry for those with smaller budgets. Additionally, the health and fitness pull outs in each issue are wonderful! Seventeen has plenty of nutrition tips and simple workouts that'll have you seeing lots of results fast.
Seventeen is a wonderful magazine overall- highly recommended.","07 4, 2004",AOR590VF8YI5J,StarGymnast,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},One of the best teen magazines,1088899200,False,3.0,Magazine_Subscriptions

The pros of the Kindle version over the paper version are that you get instant delivery of each new issue, it costs half as much per issue (and you pay per issue rather than annually), and it's more environmentally friendly, given that you've already bought a Kindle. The cons are that you miss out on some excellent graphics. Also, though the Kindle version is well-organized, the linear progression of one article after another, uninterrupted, inevitably grows tiresome. After subscribing to the Kindle version for about a year, I've decided that it's not quite worth it. I'm switching to the print edition. Of course, the same content is also available on the magazine's website at no cost, but the paper version is much easier on the eyes.","03 13, 2009",A70NFM6KHU24F,Trevor Burnham,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Not quite the print edition,1236902400,False,8.0,Magazine_Subscriptions

Then it went through some rough years where it got kind of tame and boring. Now, it's an ill fitting mix of new and old writers trying to be fresh and hip while being spoon fed by the car manufactures. The magazine lacks consistency, focus and any sort of clear vision as to what they're about.

C&D mostly seems to print what the biggest manufactures want them to. There have been several articles lately, such as on the new Nissan GT-R and Corvette ZR1, that literally mirror articles in other magazines even featuring some of the same quotes from the same car execs.

They always have a complete menu, down to the last detail, with beautiful photographs that will inspire you to copy it; ""Quick Kitchen"" with easy to make meals that are also nutritious; ""Kitchen Notebook"", filled with good tips on everything from new products to a better way to slice thin bread, and my favorite feature, ""You Asked for It"", where readers ask for the recipes of dishes they have tasted in restaurants, from Bangkok to Manhattan; Gourmet finds the recipe, tries it out, and shares it with us. Some of the most delicious morsels of the month are on this page.

Well, I was wrong. Discovery Girls is nothing special and has as many advertisements as the typical teenage magazine. Plus, the topics covered in it are nothing really special, the fashion pages are lackluster, and the advice columns and such, well, SUCK. Topics in it are also sometimes inappropriate for the 8-12 age range, as well (some issues have stuff about make up, dating, and boyfriends and girlfriends. At EIGHT years old?!?)

In addition to the high price, advertisements, and age-inappropriate articles, this magazine also is, well, boring. Nothing in it is really interesting and since it's so short, you'll probably read through it really fast (not counting ads).

Hidden between a forest of ads, you will find the occasional spindly little article, and chances are, that article will also be selling you S.T.U.F.F. with clever product placement.
The ads, which are quite wide-ranging in whatever the target audience is supposed to be, made me dazed and confused, and my nose was not pleased either, as some of them contain ""perfume"".
As for the ""tips"", not all are helpful. They suggest for instance, that you hard boil eggs, and keep them for a week in the refrigerator (page 18, November 2003 edition). True, a week is the limit for storing hard cooked eggs, and they will not kill you, but have you ever eaten an egg that has been sitting in the fridge for seven days ? It is enough to put one off the incredible edible forever. Five days is max folks, for a decent tasting egg.

B000IJ7RQ8,,5,"I've been reading Entertainment Weekly for about twenty years now, and although it's gone through a lot of changes, it's basically still my favorite magazine to receive and to read. It's a sort of a good mix of pop culture *plus* a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the *""interesting"" kind, meaning- you won't find out about Snooki's latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.

The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.

The only thing I don't like about the magazine is that it's starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there's a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I'm not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I'm not happy that now it's four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It's the same for books and television and other media, as well.

Regardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider ""necessary"". I love that I know about every movie, television show, and CD before they even get released.","09 13, 2013",A1PAGHECG401K1,Chel Micheline,,"slimmer than it used to be, but still an invaluable source of entertainment info",1379030400,True,3.0,Magazine_Subscriptions

I like the ""Yours for the Asking"" section where you can send away a postcard for more information instead of contacting each company.

For mom's, the ""kids project"" section will be amusing and your kids will love the ideas.

The cartoons are also cute and I had to laugh at the one that said: ""Of course I love you. Didn't you get my fax?""

Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.

The recipe section really has a personality all of its own. The ""Petite Caramel Apple"" recipe they had in the September 2001 issue was so adorable!

Honestly it's boring for me; no kids, I run a business with my hubby and don't care about fashion and makeup.

The ""pre"" of the makeovers usually look better than the ""post""; they do a haircut and makeup and stuff these ladies into silly skirts and peplum jackets (think Joan Collins from Dynasy if you are that old - I am!) that don't flatter their figures. Most of the family stuff doesn't apply either.

I do enjoy the crafts sometimes, and the recipes sometimes offer a gem. The budget dinners are interesting, but I can usually beat their pasta and soup per-dinner prices while serving burgers or roast.

All the customization from long board, foot board hight, beater position, direct drive position, everything on these things are costimizable. I have played on many pedals in my expiriance ( Tama Iron Cobra, Tama Speed Cobra, DW 5000, DW 9000, Yamaha DFP, Ludwig Speed King, Pearl Eliminators, and Mapax Raptors, and Axis) and I can honestly say these pedals in my honest opinion are the best pedals in the market. They work well with any kind of music. Rock, Metal, Jazz, Deathcore, Metalcore. Im in a Metalcore band and I can do anything I want with them. You can easly hit 260bpm (which is what I can hit). Triplets, all that fun stuff. The thing that really sold me about these pedals is the fact that you can convert them from a double pedal to TWO single pedals. It works awesome since for me becasue if we play a show and there isn't alot of room for two bass drums, I can just make them into a double pedal and one bass drum and im good to go.

The only bad thing I have to say about these pedals are the felt beaters that come with it. They tend to wear very quickly and you have black dust everywhere on your bass drum and pedals but just change the beater to either some Icon Cobra beaters or DWSM105 Hardcore beaters and you are set.

B00T3SR9ZO,,3,"I bought two of these. The tuner itself seems to be pretty fast and accurate, but the product design has some problems.

First, there's no way to attach it to a guitar headstock so that the display is right-side up when you're tuning; it always has to be sideways. If the little nub where the clip attaches to the tuner was on the side instead of on the bottom, like the Intellitouch PT-10, the display would orient correctly.

The other design problem is that you have to hold down the button for three seconds to turn it off. In and of itself, that's OK; but it's a dual-function button. If you release it too soon -- which is easy to do when you're reaching out to the headstock -- it changes the tuning mode. That means you have to step through all of the modes to set the tuner back to the right mode, and then hold down the button again to turn it off.

Considering the low price, I guess I shouldn't complain, and I'm not going to return them. I understand using only one button to cut costs. But really, it wouldn't have cost any more to make the thing with the attachment point in the correct position.","10 10, 2015",A7O84T8MC6IV0,RobDog,,"Close, but not quite",1444435200,True,,Musical_Instruments

B000ZJTPLG,,5,"I bought the Vox Amplug AC30 and loved it so much, it probably doubled (or tripled) the amount of time I play guitar.  I loved it so much I went out and got the more expensive (by $10) Joe Satriani Signature Amplug.  I liked the Satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the AC30, and delay feature is a lot of fun.  But I had serious questions about the Classic Rock Amplug.  Why did have only a 4-star review on Amazon - among the lowest for any of the fabulous Amplug products.  Would it be only a ""one trick pony""?

Well, I have to tell you, I was completely blown away by how great the Classic Rock Amplug is, and I'm now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews.  I've tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier, and many pedal users are seeking what they call a ""Marshall-in-a-box"".  In other words, they want a effects pedal that will single-handedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of Marshalls.  Believe it or not, the Vox Classic Rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a ""Marshall"" sound as I can imagine.  And it comes in a small, plastic headphone amplifier that runs on 2 AAA batteries and costs all of $39.99.

Functionally, the Classic Rock Amplug is the same as the AC30 - three dials for gain, tone, and volume, an aux in jack (for MP3 players), a headphone jack, and an on/off switch.  But that's where the similarities end.  While the excellent AC30 model simulates the boxy, sparkly sound of a tube amplifier, the Classic Rock packs some PUNCH.  The low end presence on this thing (even through a $20 set of entry-level Sony headphones from Target) is significantly greater than on the AC30.  More importantly, the sound doesn't deteriorate with higher volumes.  There are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones, but most of them become a static-filled mess as soon as you turn up the volume.  Amazingly, the tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap, and the ""overdrive"" is controlled through analog circuitry, with amazing clarity.

But the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug (and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here) are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob.  Several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak, or claimed that there were no clean tones.  Yet, with both my Les Paul and a Strat, I was able to set the Volume at around 6-8 and the gain at about level 2 and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume.  If any dirt was remaining, a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem.  Even better, playing a Strat into the Classic Rock with the gain set somewhere between 2 to 4 actually created a Tubescreamer-like blues tone!  This tone was one of the audio demos offered on Vox's website, but I didn't believe it for myself until I plugged the Classic Rock in and dialed in that tone.

Long story short, the Classic Rock is extremely powerful, but more verstaile than I thought.  It can do the high-gain Marshall tones I expected, but also offers a wide array of clean or slightly-overdriven tones.  It might even be more versatile than the AC30 Amplug, though I remain pretty loyal to the AC30.  The good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both.  Highly recommend the Classic Rock - 5 stars.","01 18, 2013",ADH0O8UVJOT10,StormJH1,,"Awesome Marshall tone from a product that says ""Vox"" on it!",1358467200,False,9,Musical_Instruments

B000S5MW6C,,5,"Ibanez's WD7 (Weeping Demon) is one of the most versatile wah pedals that you will ever stomp on.  Most wah pedals are one-trick ponies.  The weeping demon is the new master of wah pedals, and can make just about any wah sound that you'll need.  Your guitar will love you for this.

The casing looks awesome, and its built like a tank.  The exterior of the weeping demon is made almost entirely out of heavy duty die-cast metal (it looks sort of like sand-blasted aluminum).  I've owned mine for several years and there is barely a mark on it despite being stomped on incessantly when I practice.

Unlike most wah pedals, the power switch is not under the rocker, which I love.  With the switch to the right side of the pedal you have plenty of control, and you don't need to worry about either missing the button or over-doing it while you're rocking out.  This leaves the foot rocker free to swing.

On the left side of the pedal there is a lever.  When it is flipped towards the front of the pedal you are in standard mode where the rocker moves freely and the effect is controlled by the right-side switch.  When you flip the lever towards the back of the pedal it shifts the hardware into auto wah mode.  In auto wah mode the heel of the pedal instantly drops toward the base, and the pedal takes on a spring-loaded feel.  Rather than using the switch to activate the pedal you simply start using the pedal to automatically turn on the effect.  When you let the pedal drop back into place, it turns itself back off (with a delay if you desire).

The rocker has a wavy, rubber texture and feels good under the shoe.  To control the sound you have three knobs (level, Q, and low frequency) that allow you to adjust the character of the sound it makes and a small black switch that changes the pedal from guitar to bass mode.  A nice feature of the knobs on the weeping demon is that you can click them in and out of the body of the pedal after setting them to keep them from getting accidentally bumped while you play.  Additionally, there are two knobs under the foot rocker that allow you to further control the character of the sound and adjust the delay before the pedal turns off.

Unlike some wah pedals, this does not have negative impact on your sound.  More poorly designed wahs will add a bit of noise or hiss when the wah is powered on.  The weeping demon is completely silent when it is not in use.

The WD7 can be powered by an AC adaptor or battery.  It runs on a standard 9v DC power supply, so you can plug it up with the stock connectors of a pedalboard, use a spare adaptor from another pedal, or daisy-chain with a pedal that is capable of powering others (like the BOSS TU series).

The WD7 is the wah pedal to rule them all.","09 10, 2012",A1U74I9FWDMGEW,Joshua,,The definitive wah pedal.,1347235200,False,2,Musical_Instruments

There are so many of both types available and the value of reading reviews is that Im beginning to learn what I should stay away from.  I bought this one because I needed to round out an order and it was only a couple of bucks so if I didn't like it I could use it for something else.

As far as the hook type of mount it seems they fall into one of two broad categories  plastic or metal.  The plastic ones seem to have a lot of gimmicks but most of them appear to be made of several pieces and experience has taught me that the more pieces and parts the more things can go wrong.  Of the metal type it seems there are two similar styles. One is flat and the other, like this one, has upturned ends.  I don't want to see my instruments come tumbling down to the floor so I opted for the style with the upturned ends.

I like that it is very sturdy and the part that attaches to the wall is solid despite being all plastic.  The hooks are attached to it by some sort of rivet. The hooks are covered with a dense rubber material that doesnt scratch. It is not the porous kind of foam rubber that can interact with the wood finish on some instruments and cause it to discolor. There are little plastic caps on the ends of the hooks.  The unit comes in a little baggie with two screws and two plastic wall anchors.

Maybe the thing that concerns me the most is the hooks adjust by swiveling outward. If you have a very small instrument like a ukulele that could twist sideways it could conceivably slip between the hooks.  Likewise if your instrument is heavy it could put enough outward pressure on the hooks to let the instrument slide through.  Keep in mind this is a very low-end hanger, obviously not meant to hold a rare classic instrument.

By the way, what about using a stand instead of a wall hook?  A couple of reasons come to mind. One is the thought of the dogs knocking it over or the cats using the instrument as a scratching post. The other major reason is I have yet to find a stand that is both attractive and versatile enough to hold anything from a banjo to a balalaika. The wall hook type pretty much can hold any stringed instrument.","09 12, 2017",A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,PhotoGraphics,,Floor stand or wall hook?,1505174400,True,2,Musical_Instruments

The good things:  good finish (but darker than pictured), solid woods, well-shaped bridge (which still needed lowering and reshaping a bit), excellent pegs and tailpiece (I wanted a cello with the rosewood fittings), and very good endpin.  The hard case and the soft case that came with it were both good-enough quality.  The bad things: the varnish used is fake-glossy and has visible but small blemishes; the supplied strings are useless; and (worst of all) the back of the cello for about 8 inches on either side of the endpin had never been glued to the sides but showed a 1/16 inch air gap (and actually did not fit the sides quite right).  This last fault I did not discover till I had been playing it for a couple of months (adult beginner, experienced with violin, viola, guitar).  I would have returned it if I had noticed this fault right away.  I suspect that Cecilio's quality control is not up to par with student instruments available from other vendors.

1. The large metal snap is placed so that it will scratch most guitars. Only a solid-body electric with an upper strap button on the top cutaway, as shown in the pictures, will avoid this. On a heel button, the snap will rub on the finish. Not what I want on an SG, Les Paul, archtop, or acoustic.

2. The leather endpieces are so stiff that I was afraid I would yank the strap buttons out of the guitar, both when putting them on and later when removing them (before returning the item). Moreover the stiff leather is another likely source of scratches.

B00064TZYW,,4,"The neck on this guitar is extremely playable. I love its feel and good action more than my Guild or Martin dreadnaught-sized acoustic guitars.

The sound is tinny and small, but that is to be expected from anything with such a tiny body. It fits the bill for something totally portable.

As other reviewers have said, it doesn't sit on your leg easily. That's because the neck is heavier than the body - not because it is a heavy neck (it isn't) but because the body is so light and has a smooth, almost tear-drop shape. But you just put the strap (included) on it and it stays up just fine.

One reviewer on another site (zzsounds) said it smelled like ""an acre of used cat litter in a chemical dump."" I would not describe the smell that way, but it is clearly a disgreeable odor. Luckily, it is not a very strong odor. You have to be playing the guitar to smell it. It won't fill the room with the awful odor. After 5 days it has dissipated a little bit (or maybe I'm getting used to it) - maybe it's down 30% lower than when it arrived. Still objectionable, it is probably the smell of the lacquer they used. Not a sweet 'solvent' laquer smell - it's more of a roachy and burnt or rotting carcas-like smell. I hope it dissipates more over the next month - I'd hate to have to return this beauty. Hey Washburn - is there any other lacquer you can use? Will this nasty smell dissipate eventually? Is there anything I can do to accelerate the dissipation or outgassing and get this guitar to smell less?

If you don't care about smells like this, and you want a travel guitar, this is the way to go. If you are sensitive to odors, you'd better try it out first to see if the odor is acceptable to you or not.","05 14, 2008",A13G3FTBJ5FTOY,Jon C.

My big board has the sliders and I was always missing them when I went on gigs with the smaller one. So far this unit is top notch, as someone else has mentioned the main level LEDs seem a bit odd...they set the level fine with PFL and show levels when soloing that match my old board, but when not soloing they barely register. However, the levels are correct on my downstream gear and I think if I got all the inputs going at once the LEDs would be fine. I am getting around this by running in solo mode during my gigs :-) LOVE the XLR outputs, which my smaller board did not have, no need for 1/4"" to XLR adapters.

This sharpener can produce a graphite point two inches long, if that is what you want.  The wood is removed in one long continuous curl - a beauty to behold.

The sharpener is made of light weight magnesium. My large hands have no problem securely holding this compact sharpener.  The sharpener does not have a waste container, but the design allows my hands to remain clean - unlike other sharpeners.  I keep one in my sketch bag and another at home.

UPDATE:  Knocking this one down to 2 1/2 stars.
The thrill is gone.  The sharpener is mangling the leads which require a lot of touch-up with the sand block after sharpening.  This sharpener has 3 holes and each hole requires a different size blade - good luck on finding all 3 size replacement blades!  If you are looking for a long point sharpener, I highly recommend one of the KUM long point sharpeners.  If you use long points a lot, you may want to consider a 2mm lead holder instead of pencils.

B00IG1QTSC,,4,"If you want a 0.2mm, you pretty much have two choices, the Pentel PG2 or the Orenz. They're both plastic bodied pencils with metal tips and a ""sliding sleeve"" mechanism. Aside from that, it's night and day. The Orenz looks and feels like it belongs in this century. It's basically a Pentel Sliding Sleeve Sharp, for double the price. That's the premium you have to pay for 0.2mm. (Lead costs 3x as much, too. Don't worry about that, you're not making a 0.2mm your ""daily driver""). It's larger diameter makes it easier to grip than the PG2. Orenz has a small eraser under the metal lead advance button. The pencil seems to be fairly reliable and it's pretty stable in how it holds the lead, although there is some room for improvement. If you're using a 0.2mm pencil, you're laying down fine lines and detail, so a secure lead holder is pretty important. If you like the Sharp or Forte lines, you will be right at home with the Orenz.

Me, I'm not really a fan of those plastic bodies, but there is nothing like a GG 500, 600, or 1000 that takes 0.2mm lead. I'd snap one up, if there was. I'm weird, I want a $10 pencil for my $10.

I'm a Pental fan from way back. They're the only pencils I use these days. I only own two sorts of 0.2mm pencils, the Pentel Orenz in white and the the Pentel PG2 in black with pink trim. I own a ton of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9mm pencils, GraphGear 500, GraphGear 1000, Sharp, Sharp Sliding Sleeve, Forte Pro, Sharp Kerry (my ""dress pencils"") and the 2mm 8 color.

The 0.2mm pencils make me nostalgic. 0.2mm in 2014 is a lot like 0.3mm was in 1984. Both the Orenz and the PG2 have sliding sleeves to help protect the fragile lead. 0.3mm pencils used to have that, but none of my current ones do, not even the GG 1000. It's just not needed with modern lead. It's harder to break AIN Stein 0.3mm than it was to break the 0.5mm Hy Polymer of the 80s.

The PG2 will make you even more nostalgic. It's black and slender, and it feels like something straight out of the early 80s. More important, I feel that it holds the lead with a little less wiggle than the Orenz. On the other hand, good luck getting your hands on a PG2 for under $30. (The PG2 is no more a $30 pencil than the Orenz is a $10 pencil, again, it's the premium for 0.2mm). PG2 has a lead reminder ring that Orenz lacks, but the reminder only displays HB and H, while the current Ain lead only comes in HB and B, so the reminder is basically useless. And PG2 have no eraser.","04 4, 2015",A3F2IPSN5YSNU3,Joseph S. Wisniewski,,"Dramatically overpriced, but still a bargain.",1428105600,True,7,Office_Products

I customized a few of our glasses with  flowers, swirls, and even our names and they look so pretty. Mistakes wiped right off.

I think the glass might have still had a bit of dampness on it from being washed earlier, I will make sure the glass is completely dry next time. If it still happens on completely dry glasses then you would have to be careful about the design coming off on your hands.

I looked around at some of the nicer zippered binders on the market, but most are more than we need.  Regular plastic binders are lacking a bit and won't really hold folders...then I remembered the Trapper Keepers that were so popular when I was a kid (as an aside - in 1984, I saved up my allowance to buy the rainbow Trapper with the hearts at the bottom.  I used that until it fell apart two years later!).

I found them here at Amazon, read through some of the reviews and decided to go ahead with them.  My Trappers arrived yesterday and I was rather disappointed.  First, the cover of one was so beat up that it really looked used.  The other was in pristine condition - not sure how this happened.  Second, there are NO Trapper folders (my fault, I should have read the description very carefully!).  One *assumes* with a Trapper Keeper that there will be Trapper folders, as that's part of the POINT of the Trapper Keeper.  This is a regular 3-ring binder with some flimsy plastic dividers.  That's it.  Third, the slide-to-the-side ring opening mechanism on the Trappers of old is missing here.  This is the run-of-the-mill metal ring setup that opens in the middle.  It does require quite a bit of force to open it (MUCH more force than my Case-It zippered binder that I use for my coupons), which is tough for my 6- and 8-year olds to do.  I thought I'd be getting the slider tab opener (anyone who remembers Trappers from the 80s will know what I'm talking about).

Again, much of this is my fault - I really should have looked long and hard at the description and photos.  However, there are others like me who assume the same quality/features in a brand, so this is for you.  :)

The reason I went ahead with three stars is that I do like the durability of the nylon shell, the metal button closure seems sturdy, the binder is lightweight and not at all bulky and it will work nicely for us.  Now I just have to buy some Trapper folders and work the ring mechanism for the kids...","09 27, 2013",A2X2PARIO0U106,Amazon Customer,{'Color:': ' Green'},This is not the Trapper Keeper I remember...,1380240000,True,2,Office_Products
B00006I62X,,2,"This foot rest is ok. I purchased this elsewere on sale. It is not easy to adjust from low to high, and it does slip out of place a lot. The motion is stiff/unstable and it's noisy. The pivot is nice but it is unstable and therefore not good for your back overall as it is unstable when too much weight is put on it and your muscles have to compensate. It's noisy. the surface is nice for bare feet. I have back and spinal pain and I will be purchasing a better quality foot rest in the near future. Movement is best. I recommend the Swing Chair/aeromotion in combination with a good footrest a movable keyboard tray and a movable mouse tray, which fits on the aeromotion chair. Your knees and hips should be at the same height and parallel to the floor and you should be able to move  and stretch with your back still supported to take weight off the legs/thighs/lower spine. This whole set up is crucial for anyone sitting for long periods at a computer. A really good foot rest is an important component in all of this which this one is not.

I personally do not find the price to be unreasonable for this single yellow ink cartridges - much better than the price at the local office supply store. Based on my previous experiences with Canon printers (prior MX860 owner), I know that the many cartridges of this ink to be purchased in the future will keep me reliably and happily printing along for many thousands of pages to come.

It may just be my own subjective impression, but I personally find that OEM ink cartridges seem to not only provide consistently better print quality, but also last noticeably longer than the diverse lower priced knockoffs that are available.

The business end looks crude & not quite finished and the edges & tip is blunt/square. While I feel pretty confident that the metal part will have a long life, it has been my experience that the handles are generally the first to go(break). Surprisingly, the handle on this shovel looks just like every other fiberglass handle. @ $40, I really hope I'm missing a hidden something that's revolutionary inside the handle, but this sort of concerns me. Add to that that I received absolutely nothing about their limited warranty...This concerns me big time! I'm not sure how long Bully Tools has been in business or if they will be around when that inevitable time comes but I am concerned about the lack of warranty info...I got nothing! The Amazon ad says limited warranty but I didn't see any explanation so I do not know what that means but I have a hunch... At a minimum, my guess is that customers are SOL when it comes to return shipping costs for this piece of battleship metal not to mention, who keeps their cardboard shovel box for years just in case they needed to mail it back??? I can tell you that Lowes' Kolbalt shovels have a LIFETIME warranty, no questions asked, but they are JUNK just like every other Kolbalt tool I've bought.

B000LO4FFG,,5,"This is a great starter kit! You can add on to it later too. Having a drip system is the only way I can manage my garden because you can ensure that each plant gets the water it needs, you can water all of them at once, and you don't need any great skill to install it.

That said, here are a couple of (hopefully) helpful notes. First, the tubing is easier to manage when it is warm. Consider letting it sit in the sun for 15 minutes before you get started installing it.

Second, gardening gloves will help you grip the tubing better.

Third, it is hard to dismantle this and reassemble this,  not impossible, but hard. You will end up with little leaks and you'll probably waste some of the tubing and connectors that you can't get unconnected. Take the time to lay out your plan before you attach things together.

Fourth, the brown drip hose can be used to water trees really well. Cut a piece that includes about three holes. Wrap around the tree once and connect with a 1/2 T connector so that you have a ring around the base. Hook this up to the black 1/2 inch tubing and you are set. Hook up several trees this way.

Finally, this is not really what you need if you are trying to water rows of crops, like carrots or beets, where you have a plant every several inches. You would want soaker/weeper hose for that. You can get that and connect it up with this kit.","05 5, 2014",A11N4Z44GH6RPJ,Sarah,,a great way to water,1399248000,True,75,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

B00YO14FRA,,3,"I used several different seeds and seed mixes in this feeder. The primary seed used was a mix to attract chickadees, nuthatches and woodpeckers. It contained a mixture of different sized sunflower seeds (shelled, black and stripped) and small nuts and nut pieces.  I even chopped up suet and placed it in with the other seed at times. While all of these birds and others regularly visited this feeder, squirrels were a problem.

Initially the squirrels would hang upside down and fish out what they could from the feeder. Occasionally they would manage to twist the top off the bottom of the feeder. As squirrels started to dismantle the feeder more often, I ended up drilling a hole in the top and inserting a pin to prevent the bottom from twisting off of the top while the pin was in place. This helped keep the squirrels from taking it apart but eventually they just chewed through the wire mesh. I don't expect it to be too much longer before the squirrel damage prevents it from holding seed.

While I loved this feeder because it attracted a wide range of birds with the seed mix I used and it was attractive, it needs to be improved. On the top of my improvement list is thicker\stronger mesh to prevent squirrels from being able to chew through it and a locking mechanism to prevent squirrels from taking it apart. For the price I paid ($17.99), I expected it to be more durable and more squirrel-proof.

B000JJYPYE,,5,"These spikes are for Fruit & Citrus Trees and they are a great way to provide nutrients without a lot of fuss. It's supposed to be done in early spring and once again in mid-fall, when the soil is moist and soft (very important). You can also water the soil first if it isn't already moist and soft. We have very hard, clay soil. The key for us is to soften the ground first, getting it wet enough to make a hole, and then hammer the spikes into them. I use a rubber mallet, which has made a huge difference. My 'master gardener' neighbor had problems with his using a regular hammer, because the spikes fell apart. He was impressed when I showed him how it works with the rubber mallet.  Otherwise it doesn't work well with our soil.

There is a 'Guaranteed Analysis' on the bag which gives the following information. You need a magnifying glass to read it. For those who are new to these spikes, this is where the Fruit & Citrus tree spikes differ from those meant for trees in general and/or evergreen trees & shrubs.
Total Nitrogen 10.0% 10% Ammoniacal Nitrogen
Available Phosphate 15.0%
Soluble Potash 15.0%.
Sulfur 9.0%. 9.0% Combined Sufur
Derived from Ammonium Sulfate, Ammonium Phosphate, and Potassium Chloride.

It's easy.

*Choose a spot 2 ft. from the tree trunk (or shrub). Keep the spikes at least 3 ft. apart.
*Make sure the ground is soft and moist.
*In our very hard soil we go ahead and create a hole for it first rather than destroying it trying to drive it in with a hammer.
*Put the plastic cap on top of the spike. If you have a rubber mallet, that makes it easier.
*Drive the spike into the ground around the drip line.
*Once you get the spike just above the ground, remove the cap for future use, and drive the spike the rest of the way underground, 2 inches below the soil surface.

How many do you need?
If you have a tree (or shrub) with a drip line 4 feet in diameter, you need just 1 spike.
For a 6 feet in diameter drip line, use 3 spikes.
For a 8 feet in diameter drip line, use 5 spikes.
For a 10 feet in diameter drip line, use 7 spikes.
For a 12 feet in diameter drip line, use 10 spikes.
For a 15 feet in diameter drip line, use 16 spikes. YIKES!

B00CH9TS9G,,5,"As a maintainer for the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, I chat with other volunteers about their favorite tools, and believe me the discussions can become passionate. One of the trainers for our maintainers took this position when I asked him if these pruning shears were any good: ""couldn't say offhand - typically we use larger loppers or smaller pruners. I haven't ever used shears for trail maintenance, though we do have two older pairs in the local tool cache. I do know that Fiskars is one of the most readily-available brands, and I haven't had any issues with their other products. A local Home Depot or gardening center would likely be able to give better information on shears.""

Approaching 80, I decided to use these on a recent maintaining expedition on the Orange Trail at High Mountain State Park.

Frankly they got a bit of getting used to; the manufacturer who has great customer service and who offered me these shears for a Review -- sent me some great instructions. My first instinct when feeling resistance is to push through, but with these you back off the pressure until you hear a click -- very audible in the forest -- and then lightly squeeze again.

Fun really, and as my hands get weaker I will use them again, and perhaps more and more. Not yet committed enough to put them into my tool backpack but will certainly store them in the trunk of my car for that evil day.

How to Unlock Your Pruner

Apply pressure by squeezing on the handles to release the pressure on the slider. The slider should then easily move to unlock the pruner.

How to Use a Ratchet Pruner

In order to gain the maximum benefit from your ratchet pruner, you need to use it correctly.  A ratchet pruner is used differently to a conventional pruner.

1. Open pruner all the way.

2. Place pruner on the branch, as far into the jaw as possible. If you don't place branch past the midway point, you will not have maximum leverage and the branch may be difficult to cut.

3. Squeeze the handles together, advancing the blade through the branch with minimal effort. Once you feel increased handle resistance, STOP squeezing.

4. Release pressure to open the shear slightly until you hear a definite CLICK.  Again STOP and do not open the blade any further.

5. Squeeze again, repeating steps 3 and 4 to completely finish the cut. Do not pull or rip at the branch.

Caring and Maintaining Your Ratchet Pruner

Taking good care of your pruner will help ensure they work well and remain trouble free.

1. Use a clean cloth to wipe the blade of any residue.

2. Remove any debris around the spring or ratchet mechanism.

3. Apply a coat of oil (I use WD-40 because it is so versatile) to your newly cleaned pruning shears.

4. Oil also helps your pruners open and close smoothly without catching or sticking.

5. Use a rag or paper towel and wipe off any oil residue, leaving a thin coat of oil.","11 8, 2015",A2NN6H2RZENG24,Robert C Ross,,Very nice shears that have given this codger something new to learn under the sun on the maintenance trails.,1446940800,False,,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

B0045UBB8G,,5,"I use my grill at least once a week year round.  So I guess I can say that I am a heavy grill user.
I did a lot off research before buying this grill.  My two burner grill that I have used for the past 13 years finally had more holes in the bottom than what I could handle.  I wanted to replace the grill with the same make but to my dismay I found out that the grill is now manufactured in China and that it is manufactured with inferior steel.
So my quest started to find a replacement for my trusty but tired old grill.

I have always heard that Weber is the best in grills but I was not convinced.  I research a lot, comparing the Webber to just about every other brand on the market and the Webber always came out on top.  After I decided on the Webber I priced shop a lot and found that the price for the Webber is basically the same all round.  I ordered the grill from Amazon and it arrived a few days later.  The grill is heavy.  I opened the box and carried the parts to the deck where I assembled it.  I opened all the boxes and laid the parts out on the deck before I started the assembly.  That made the task easier for me.

I took me about 3 hours to assemble the grill on my own.  I took my time and made sure that I followed the instructions to the letter.  The parts all fitted without any problems.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that you can save time by using a proper wrench instead of the wrench that comes with the grill.  I also had to use a little bit of force to make some of the holes fit when installing the side burner.  It was a minor inconvenience and not real issue.

After I assembled the grill I hooked the gas tank up and it fired up immediately.  I could tell that this grill is in a different class than my previous grill which was pretty good.  It heated up very quickly.
I have already grilled ribs, chops, steaks and salmon on it.  All of the food was very tasty.  This grill is fantastic it is easy to control the temperature and the sear burner gives you all the power that you need.  The side burner is very potent to. I have used it to make breakfast and stir-fry in a wok and it has all the heat that I would want.
I am very glad that I took the time to research and made a decision on this grill.  It looks good it grills well and it is a quality tool for a backyard griller.  One last observation, my wife bought me the Webber grill book and there are a lot of useful tips and recipes in the book.  I am looking forward to spend many happy hours around this grill.","05 20, 2013",A2TH3HVIUOS2PF,MJvR,{'Style:': ' Liquid Propane'},Its simply the best.,1369008000,True,14,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

We had plenty of weeds to pick today, so these garden gloves got a good workout. I am actually not used to wearing garden gloves (because I never had any good ones) - I usually would use non-latex disposable gloves. I have tried to use garden gloves before but they were much too large to fit my very small hands, so it didn't work out.

First of all, if you have small hands, these will work! It helps that the part of the glove that goes over your wrist is a little long and tight but flexible around your wrist, because it keeps them in place really well. After hours of use, these gloves do not seem to be worn out at all. I have not had to wash them yet, and I will probably put them to the test and see how long I can go until they really seem like they need to be washed. I think that will also prolong their life.

I am very pleased with these garden gloves. It was very simple for me to pick weeds with these. They have a good rubber grip on the palm side and a lightweight, comfortable material on the rest of the glove. These gloves are hypoallergenic, which is great because my skin is very sensitive. That was one of the things that drew me to purchase them.

Also, this package comes with 4 sets of gloves!! What a deal. I can't complain about that.

Really happy with these gloves. Worth the money and would recommend and purchase again.

Update 9/1/16: I washed these gloves for the first time in a delicates/garment bag in the wash. Bad idea. One of the fingers came off like it was sliced off. To give these gloves credit, I should add that the garment bag was not the best one I have and has been known to come open in the wash. Moral of the story: hand wash only. I should have known this, but I guess I was just being lazy.","08 20, 2016",A222J729TG1QRA,Michelle Lynn,,Perfect garden gloves for small hands and/or sensitive skin!,1471651200,True,11,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

B001BIZ98I,,1,"Ordered two of these with five other plants, and highly pleased with the product.
(Seven pack of plants, 66$ worth + 18$ shipping/handling)

Slightly disappointed in the shipping/packing method; definitely did not get the $18 in care/handling paid for- there was no 'heat pack' as stated to prohibit chills- though they arrived ahead of time- could have been disastrous if the new england storm predicted today was just a little earlier. I am thankful to have a very nice and *gentle* post man!

The shipping was usps, so for what they charge, should have been much, much better packaging and assembly- which could have been done more cost effectively, given a little planning. There were no heat packs, as listed in seller review.

Plants SHOULD have been placed upright in a plant carrier inside the box, (either styro or plain common plastic you see at garden centers would do) and wrapped in a hole-punched bag to protect the foliage and stems, WITH a heat pack.

Advice to seller: save money on the styro pnuts as they only bruise and pinch the leaves during shipping, especially if the plants are jammed in on their sides with bent stems in an 'every other' layering technique which only means if the box is dropped on its side the other pairs are landing on top of them. Heck, taping them into a styro cooler/box would have been better than taping over the pot and stuffing them into the box crisscross style with pnuts. And if you charge for heat packs- SEND them.

This product ultimately failed and was refunded with option to reorder. I happily reordered as originally the seller was reasonable enough to refund the failed product. The 132.20 reorder was a disaster. It was shipped two day air USPS, and left in a warehouse all weekend where of course the plants were dying by the time they got to me. Not only that but they had fungus, mold, snails and aphids. I warned the seller upfront the package did not arrive. Instead of resending and opting out on insurance, he has been quite unreasonable- not even after the package arrived has the situation been close to resolution, despite my offer to accept replacements or a refund. He is stalling constantly, requesting two emails of pictures and proof, then requesting I file an Amazon Claim when the purchase was from his website, and now requests I pay to send him back the mangled rotting plants which I paid nearly $20 to have shipped to me in distressed condition. Though supposedly covered under the Amazon Guarantee I've had no luck, even as an Amazon Prime Member!

B0016A91PS,,4,"We'd been having trouble getting our greyhound to eat in the mornings.  At night, he was fine eating his presented kibble, but couldn't eat more than 2 cups at dinner, so he quickly started to lose weight from skipping breakfast.  He is exercised regularly, not given many treats, and is otherwise healthy; we concluded that he associated eating in the morning with me leaving, as he has recently been improving/able to cope with ongoing separation anxiety.  So, while he can now tolerate me being gone and can remain at home calmly and quietly without hurting himself or the house, it still would make him lose his appetite at the thought of me leaving since it was part of the routine.

We bought this food to give it a try and see if it would help him eat more and keep weight on and generally be happier.  Wet food (of the high quality stuff) didn't help too much because he could pick out the pieces around the kibble.  I wanted a mix that I could mix with his kibble that he'd adore.  Well, that's exactly what Grandma Lucy's is!  From day one, he's loved and looked forward to breakfast time.  At night, he still only gets kibble soaked in water, but eating at night was never an issue with him since I'm always around.  Grandma Lucy's is an excellent product.  I'll admit, it doesn't really look to appetizing to me, but there's no denying that my dog adores it.  As I mentioned, I don't use it as a sole diet; I mix 1/2 a cup (pre-water) with his kibble and it makes a mushy slop, but he gobbles up every last drop.  Even after having a fair amount of it, he had normal stool after the first day; this is not typical for him, as it normally takes his system a week or so (even with gradual food introductions) for him to not get stomach upset.

Grandma Lucy's is the best deal I've seen for dehydrated foods, especially if you buy 10lbs at once (I've seen it for $65 on here) which would make it a little over a dollar a pound. For the way I use the food, this works well for me.  Not sure what it does for their teeth, being so mushy, but I brush my dog's teeth daily so this was not a concern for me.

Con:
Smaller size than expected - under 1/2"" in diameter. I'd prefer large, heavy wafers for my large pleco. My pleco would prefer it too since these little wafers disappear before he gets active.

Pro:
Fish LOVE these things! They're like rabid dogs attacking little green 'frisbees' when these hit the water!
These are small enough for 2 - 4"" fish to carry off to a protected spot to feed on.

B001411SK0,,5,"I contemplated purchasing this system for about a year.  I am so glad I finally did!  I have three cats and was using Feline Pine in a regular litter box (I had a total of three boxes).  I just replaced each regular litter box with a Breeze box every 1-2 weeks.  The cats caught on fast and did not have any issues with using the Breeze system.  Also, two of my cats are rather large cats (part Maine Coon), with one weighing 16 lbs, and neither of them have had any issues with the size of the boxes.

I was initially worried that the feces would smell bad, because I thought they would not able to cover it up as well, but this has not been a problem.  They can actually cover it up quite well with the pellets.  And I also bought a Litter Champ, so I just check the boxes in the morning and again at night and just scoop out the feces at that time.  There really is no smell to complain of with the feces or the urine.  It really is so much simpler than using Feline Pine in a regular box.

I have also not found the pellets or the pads to be too expensive - I use Amazon's subscribe and save program for both.

I cannot recommend this product more highly... I wish I had owned it all along.","12 9, 2012",A3KJ6JZ8MWERPG,RnnrGrl,{'Style:': ' Open System'},So glad I finally purchased this product!,1355011200,True,,Pet_Supplies

I bought it from her office for two years, then I realized I could get the exact same thing here on Amazon for much less.  I compared the boxes, and it is the same.  I've been using this collar on my mature beagle mix dog with great results.  He is inside most of the time;  however, we walk at least twice a day, through fields, grass and woods. If I'm working outside, he's right by my side or often laying in the grass.  I have not seen any flea bites on him and have not seen any fleas or ticks on him since using the collar.  Though, I understand they can still get on him.  This collar does not irritate his skin or make him sick.  The collar is a generous length and I think would be enough to fit most any dog.  As directed by my veterinarian, after cutting to the correct fit with a couple inches extra to securely buckle it, I used a couple pieces of tape to attach it to the inside of my dogs' collar. This allows it to be in contact with the dog in order to work properly and not get tangled with his other collar.  I would recommend this collar.","10 16, 2016",A1NG5BNY3JE0BV,Snoopy,,Works well and doesn't irritate my dogs' skin.,1476576000,True,,Pet_Supplies

I've been going through about 6-8 of them per day. I have also been using them to ""mop up"" around the room when the puppies have accidents on the tile floor and they absorb very well in that way, as well. I can't say how they work with adult dogs that are being potty trained, as that is not the purpose I'm using them for. They stay in place very well in side the training crates and also on the floor, but be advised - little puppies will probably try and drag them around the room for fun - mine do, but that's just because EVERYTHING is interesting and new to them. Mom and dad doggies just leave them alone, but they also have access to a doggy door to go out side, so they don't use the pads exclusively.

Pros:
- They are thick.
- the container is designed so that they don't easily dry out--I've had a box for 10 months and the few remaining are still moist.

Cons:
- In an effort to make them flushable (fair warning: any plumber will tell you NEVER flush this kind of thing) it's very easy to poke a finger right through them.
- They're kind of small.
- They leave my skin feeling sticky.

Overall the only thing I found better with these than regular old baby wipes is their thickness and the container design. Thickness is meaningless when my finger pokes holes in them. Baby wipes dry out faster but I can always put a little water back in the carton.","01 9, 2018",A2U29QTPWN3CEY,Periwinkle,,Kind of mixed feelings on these,1515456000,True,5.0,Prime_Pantry

B002DHGM50,,4,"If you've had the chance to see Apple's newest attack add against Windows in which the nerdy PC guy goes back through time talking about how the most recent version of Windows will fix all the problems from the last, you might be asking yourself if it really is worth upgrading to Windows 7. Aside from the fact that the add is grossly unfair (considering Apple released quite a few OS during the same years as Windows, and none of them were perfect either), the add has a point: some Windows versions have been inferior or even downright terrible (ME for example). That said, Windows 7 is a great OS, really a dramatic improvement in many ways, and should not be ignored. The short answer is you should absolutely upgrade from either XP or Vista. The longer answer is still a yes, but that you need to understand what you're buying and how you can use it first.

I think much of the confusion about this version of Windows 7 surrounds the title 'upgrade.' Many have taken 'upgrade' to mean that one can seamlessly move from XP or Vista without having to reinstall anything. This is not always the case depending on what OS you are upgrading from. Here 'upgrade' means that you are 'upgrading' from one OS to another. The retail versions are being sold for systems that have no OS in place at all--for example a new system build. I agree that Microsoft (and Amazon for that matter) could and should have been explicit about this--unfortunately they were not, and that's left a sour taste in the mouths of many, which I totally understand. Adding to the confusion is that you can seamlessly upgrade from Vista Professional with this version, but NOT Visa Home Premium, NOR Vista Ultimate. Microsoft did not do a good job of making the seamless upgrade paths clear, so here they are:

If you are upgrading from XP (any version) you MUST do a clean install of Windows 7. No seamless upgrade route is available. However, you CAN do a dual boot installation that will allow you to keep XP and run it in tandem with Windows 7. This is a great route if you have programs that may not run on Windows 7 (I've yet to find one myself--everything I have runs perfectly).
If you have XP, you should do a clean install. Even if it is time consuming, it bears a multitude of benefits for you and your computer in the long run. If you're dead set on upgrading from XP and keeping your programs, you could try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laplink-Windows-7-Upgrade-Assistant/dp/B002TOL9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laplink Windows 7 Upgrade Assistant</a>&nbsp;but I would NOT recommend it.

If you are upgrading from Vista, here is what you need for a seamless upgraded:

Vista Home Premium:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLUWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade</a>

Vista Professional:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Professional-Upgrade/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Professional Upgrade</a>

Vista Ultimate:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Ultimate-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade</a>

Keep in mind that you MUST install the same system type (32-bit or 64-bit) as your current version of Vista to have a seamless upgrade route available! You cannot upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit system and keep your programs (well actually you can keep some of them, but more on that later). Since you are provided both 32-bit and 64-bit installation disks, you can choose which version you want to run. If you have newer hardware, 64-bit is probably the way to go as it is faster and will allow you to take advantage of more than 3.5gb of system RAM.

The silliest part of the upgrade scheme is that you CANNOT do a downgrade 'upgrade.' In other words, you cannot downgrade from Visa Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional through the seamless route! This defies logic and explanation from Microsoft, and is the reason I've knocked a star off an otherwise nearly perfect OS.

Personally I did a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit over a Vista 64-bit system (I chose the clean install method because I believe it represents the best route to a trouble free and 'clean' feeling system). I installed over my old Windows directory (which I had backed up by creating a disk image using Acronis True Image Home just in case anything went wrong. Installation took about 30 minutes, actually much faster than any other OS install I've ever done. All of my hardware was recognized and drivers were installed without a hitch. The old windows files are moved to a windows.old file which contains all of your user accounts, program files, and old Windows files. It is possible to open the programs file (in windows.old) and copy over many programs into your new programs file and some of them will work perfectly fine. I was able to do with with all my web browsers, a few computer games, and some random applications. Not EVERYTHING will work, but many will and it's worth at least testing it out.

I've since upgraded several other computers (my wife's laptop, a few computers at work). My wife's was a simple streamline upgrade from vista home to Windows 7 home (32-bit to 32-bit). It took a bit longer, probably about an hour, but managed to keep all programs and settings from Vista. The others were clean install upgrades. The only one that I had an issue with was upgrading a 32-bit system to a 64-bit system. I installed to a different hard drive and booted up to W7 just fine. However, I could not delete the old windows files from the previous installation. I followed various Googled help pages on taking ownership of files, etc., but was unable to get all the files to delete no matter what I did. Ultimately I was forced to physically remove the hard drive, put it into an enclosure, and delete the files using a separate computer. The UAC (User Account Control) system that prevents system files from being deleted was in this case out of control and impossible to overcome--even for an middle-advanced computer user who knows how to troubleshoot/problem solve using online resources. For someone with less experience, it would have been even more frustrating I am sure.

Many others have gone into great detail about the feature set of Windows 7 and the various improvements from Vista, so I will not spend much time running through all of them again. Suffice it to say that Aero works wonderfully, QuickSnap is amazing, especially on a larger monitor, and that all of the visual tweaks are nicely done and very welcome. The reorganization of the start menu is wonderful and makes the W7 task bar nearly perfect. Add a simple dock program to the mix like RocketDock (google it) and this OS is hands down better than even Snow Leopard--which is pretty awesome.

Performance is also great. My boot time went from 1:47 to :56! Nearly a minute faster! (Hardware: E8500, P45 Asus Striker MB, 8GB ram, Hd4870 x2 in crossfire). Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use. Everything Vista wasn't, W7 is.

I'm very pleased with W7, and aside from some miserable communication from Microsoft about what upgrade means and what can upgrade to what, it's nearly flawless. If you want a stable, fast, visually appealing and advances OS, W7 will not disappoint. Just make sure you know what you're buying so that you don't end up dissatisfied.

I switched to the mac 1.5 years ago and have been intensely using iLife '08 for the entire time.  The suite of programs is just incredible.  I would probably pay upwards of $600 for the suite of programs, and it costs only [...].  Crazy.

The following review covers the new features added in iLife '09 that weren't in iLife '08.  There are a lot of new features, and I'll update my review after I spend time with each one.

iPhoto '09
FACE RECOGNITION: My iPhoto library is relatively small at 14,000 photos, most of which feature friends and family.  Because I'm a bit OCD, with iPhoto '08, I took the time to label all the photos with the names of the people contained in each picture.  I did this by writing the person's name in the ""Key Words"" field of each photo.  For a variety of reasons, my iPhoto library is much more valuable and useful to me when they are properly labeled with people's names.  As such, I was intrigued by the face recognition feature of iPhoto '09.  After allowing iPhoto '09 to scan my library of photos for faces (which took about 3 hours), I spent a handful of hours training iPhoto to know what everyone's faces look like.  This process (if you know how to do it) is indeed easier than the old way (of me typing in people's names in the ""key words"" field under each photo).  The facial recognition is pretty good, or maybe very good.  The problem I've discovered is that facial recognition is never going to be perfect.  Indeed some of the best photos have friends or family with their backs turned to the camera, or whatever, so facial recognition doesn't notice them.  If I were to rely solely on the facial recognition in iPhoto '09, I would fail to properly label all my pictures ... I'd miss some really really good pictures.  Then, months later, when I'm looking for a photo with my friend Sam, I won't be able to find certain photos, because it was never properly labeled with his name.  Long story short, I won't be using the facial recognition feature.  Instead, I'm going to continue to mark all my photos with names in the ""key words"" field of each photo.  Note also, the facial recognition feature cannot find the face of my parents' Dalmatian dog.

PRINTED BOOKS (MAPS FEATURE): the printed books that I've created with iPhoto '08 are amazing.  I've had several people say, ""I've gotta get a mac"" when they see the books I've made.  And, a few months ago, Apple announced that the pictures in the printed books are going to be even higher-res (haven't had a chance to print a book since the announcement), so the books should look even better now. A new feature in iPhoto '09 is the ability to add custom maps to your books.  For instance, I created a book with a map showing a travel line from NYC-Helsinki-Warsaw-Cracow-Budapest-Vienna-Prague.  The map looks awesome (see photo uploaded to amazon).  Printed books make the perfect gift or coffee table book.  (TIP: after you create the map, right-click on the map for additional advanced options (e.g., changing the connecting lines from _curved_ lines to _straight_ lines).  Criticism: while the large-scale maps (i.e., big city to big city to big city) look great, zoomed-in maps (i.e., of an individual city or town) have no detail.  (See the photo uploaded to amazon of my map of Warsaw, Poland).  Hopefully they'll fix this.

GEOTAGGING: this feature is so cool and totally belongs within iPhoto.  Years from now, when all the cameras have GPS built inside, it is going to be so convenient to have this metadata attached to photos.  That being said, I cannot imaging spending the time to label my 14,000 photos that don't currently have that data.  I did buy the ""Amod AGL3080 GPS Data Logger,"" to carry with me on trips so that I can add GPS data to new pictures I take.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  Update: I've had a chance to manually geotag some pictures (e.g., this batch of photos is ""Warsaw, Poland"").  It's pretty easy to tag photos.  That being said, there's really nothing amazing about having geotagged photos.  Hopefully future iterations of iLife will make use of having geotagged photos and movies (e.g., smart slide shows or movies that automatically include maps that zoom into pictures, or something).

GarageBand '09
MUSIC LESSONS: this is the most exciting part of iLife '09 for me.  These lessons look _better than real lessons_.  Seriously, better than live lessons with a real human.  I started the guitar lessons a week ago, and I just love them.  I can do the lesson over and over, at my own pace.  Apple really slammed this one out of the park.  I can't wait until I get good enough to use one of the $5 artist lessons.  Note: there are 9 free introductory piano lessons, and 9 free introductory guitar lessons (the lessons feature an acoustic guitar, but they appear to be useful for learning both acoustic and electric guitar ... same principles).  Note: Garageband includes a tuner, so that you can tune your guitar via your mac's microphone.  Well, it sucks and is nearly useless. (I'm using my iMac's built-in microphone).  I'm glad I bought this tuner: Korg GA-30 Ultra Compact Guitar and Bass Tuner (it works for both my electric and acoustic guitar).

B0039Y58YC,,3,"WordPerfect 5.0 for Windows 7.0

My major use of the suite is WordPerfect. I've been a WP user for over two decades, and I briefly trained people on the program in a large company in the late 1980s. There was a time when I was a power user but I am out of practice with some advanced features.

The below comments reflect Windows on a 64-bit system. Some of the problems (especially search) reflect Windows, not WP.

Good features of WP: Reveal codes. Much more control over tables than in MS-Word. Foreign character sets. Mathematical formulas still better than MS-Word, but the interface has gotten steadily worse over time. WP imports and exports MS-Word documents very well, but the reverse is not true.

Bad: Too many crashes. It doesn't remember your open files when crashes or if the system forces closure. Search didn't work until the latest Service Pack. I can't save user-defined page sizes with all of the attributes, but I have to reset each time. Over the years Corel has made the macro function worse. Not competitive with MS-Word on collaboration, such as ""comments"" and tracking changes.

Other items in the suite: QuattroPro and Excel are essentially interchangeable for an intermediate user such as myself; advanced users may distinguish the two.

Over the years, I've gotten used to using Presentations for designing graphics but I use PowerPoint for public presentations. I'm likely to keep that habit, as Presentations works better with WordPerfect, my primary word processor. However, I often give PowerPoints from someone else's computer, and it's easier to use the software of the Evil Empire in those cases.

In short, I will remain a Corel/WP user but the reasons to do so are getting smaller.","11 4, 2011",A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO,Arthur Digbee,,Not fully 64-bit ready.,1320364800,False,,Software

But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.","01 6, 2014",A1PSBR3JRZ9VO0,Vdub,{'Platform:': ' PC/Mac Disc'},"If you've used TurboTax before, you know what to expect.",1388966400,False,,Software

 It allows you to search by keyword for customer or vendor names, transaction types, amounts, dates, and more.

I can also access everything from my iPhone with the Office Mobile app. I also have a Kindle Fire, but it isn't supported at this time.

You can see all of your uploaded documents on the  ""My Office"" web page. You can also create new Word, Excel, PowerPoints there, too. Using the ""Web"" version to do so is very similar to Google Docs - only with more features/functionality.

Unlike other cloud-based sharing sites, saving to your SkyDrive is as simple as saving the document. For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).

The public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: ""Direct Link,"" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.

B000HCZ9AW,,4,"I usually assemble my own PCs, but this spring, I decided to gamble on a factory machine. Being a gamer and an artist, I wanted a good performance rig festooned with removable storage ports and cable jacks. So I picked up an HP Media Center and discovered Windows Vista.

Vista Home Premium is to Windows XP as XP was to the Windows 9x series. In other words, I think it's a leap: one of Microsoft's most radical changes in interface, capability, and security that I've experienced. And I've laid my hands on almost every Windows OS since 1992.

Enough so that I find Vista to be superfluous despite its changes. XP users in particular need not apply (an upgrade that is, yuck yuck!).  But for anybody who's looking to finally replace that trusty old copy of 98 Second Edition, or who wants to jump on the multiprocessor, dual video card, high-def graphic experience, then this is the system for you. Just beware--here there be bugs and compatibility issues.

->DOWN TO DETAILS<-

Despite all my talk about big leaps, there is nothing that Vista does that XP users can't do without. Home Premium bundles a number of apps `n' applets that XP must apply separately, but nevertheless is able to apply. Otherwise, the remaining differences are pretty looking, but pretty useless.

>Aeroplane and Horsepower

Such as a new ""glass"" interface called Aero. Everything about it, including the cute sidebar, the marble Start button, and fancy-pants window switching, windows thumbnail, and windows sizing effects--looks better than the ""Fisher Price"" XP. Or any previous version of Windows, for that matter. Vista runs simple effects, such as color-coding file names to indicate a compressed file. And more complex effects: hover the mouse pointer over a program in the taskbar, and a cute little thumbnail screenshot pops up; while hitting the ""switch window"" button in the quick launch box will stack full size pics of your open programs to sort through.

This interface is one of the shallow leaps from XP. It doesn't have much utility but it sure looks like it needs hardware to run. Except Aero ran just fine on my low-range, low powered graphics card installed by the factory: an NVIDIA OEM 7500 LE. And I have confirmed that it will run, if a bit sluggishly, on a single gig of RAM with a modest dual-core processor. Vista also comes preloaded with Direct X 10, which itself is supposed to be a revolution in graphics processing. Since I have no DX10 programs other than Vista, I can't tell you whether this matters or not.

>Stability

What might matter to the performance minded user: stability. I've only used Vista for a couple of months, but I have suffered no OS crashes or freezes. Unlike XP which, while the most stable Windows of its time, still bugged out on me at least once a month. Individual programs still crash or fail to respond--notably AOL and Word 2007. Also, closing a program sometimes triggers a ""Stopped Working"" error message, but I detect no actual harm and I can load such a program right back up. So far Vista has taken every peripheral, drive, and PC card I've thrown at it. On a down note, VHP is so big that a Norton virus scan or disk defrag takes roughly twice as long as it did in XP.

Update 15 AUG 2007: After installing my PSU and graphic card, I noticed system hangs at startup. These seem to be resolved after a recent update. Also, the aforementioned app crashes have been resolved by updates.

Now, in performance, I include the improved power options. Three pre-set states exist: from high-performance/low-savings, to a balanced system, to energy efficiency but low performance. Additionally, the low-power states of previous Windows have been combined in a newish ""Sleep"" mode. According to my documentation, putting the computer into Sleep mode is actually preferable to shutting down the system every night, presumably because Vista runs a number of maintenance programs when I am not looking. These power settings integrate with my monitor's own energy program, incidentally.

>Security

Speaking of management, Vista includes User Account Controls, which basically asks your permission every...single...time...you attempt to install a program, uninstall a program, or run any sort of program which significantly affects the performance of Windows. As an XP veteran myself, I just turn this annoying feature off, since there is currently no scalability to this control (that is, I can't order it what to watch and what to ignore). Vista also has a detailed file sharing security system, to the extent that even an Administrator account can be denied permission to move that Metallica MP3 from your Download folder to your KigAzz Musik folder. No, really, it is that buggy and intrusive.

>Bells n Whistles

Vista also comes preloaded with its own firewall, calendars, news tickers, and system monitors that XP users can separately plug in. Annoyingly, Vista itself has no CPU temperature widget--I have to go into my BIOS for that.

What I think is more useful are all the inherent, if generic, multimedia applications. Vista Home Premium supports HD DVD and HDTV. And users can access their media, including music and video files as well as television, through a Windows Media Center interface. VHP includes generic video capture capability, generic movie editing, generic DVD home movie burning, generic picture gallery, and of course, those old stalwarts, Paint and Sound Recorder (Note that the capabilities of Sound Recorder have been greatly reduced, to the point that in premium it can only record in .wma format and with no onboard editing or sound effect capability). The interface itself is reorganized to include more recognition for gamers. All of your games can be found in a dedicated tab within the Start menu.

Speaking of gamers, Vista is supposed to support games in other ways as well. There's the new Games for Windows protocol, which I really don't know much about, in addition to the graphics support. DX10, incidentally, includes a number of back-compatible Direct3D APIs to support XP-era programs. Games like *Oblivion* run like a dream, while the infamous audio stutter bug of *Half-Life 2* is actually worse than on my XP rig.

Keep in mind also that many new hardware devices still support XP. My new NIVIDA 8600 GTS, for example, includes DX9.0c and supports such systems, even though it is a DX10 card.

->SEND OUT THE BUGS<-

Unfortunately, none of this seems to be enough for *Max Payne* and *Max Payne 2*, which I have been unable to get going on VHP. And that leads me to the compatibility issues. The Windows Upgrade Advisor utility isn't entirely accurate about what software will run well in Vista. I had to replace all of my Norton Software, and I was disgusted to discover that the 2007 edition of SystemWorks still wasn't Vista compatible! And yet, my ancient copy of Adobe Photoshop LE 5.0 functions well enough. My old Canon Zoombrowser has some graphic issues with the buttons, but the pictures themselves appear just fine.

Not so fine are some media limitations. Home Premium includes Windows Media Player 11. This program will write album tags to newly ripped .WAV files. However, old .WAV files cannot be tagged, and will be permanently lumped together under the ""Unknown Album"" section. Because officially, WMP 11 does not support metadata for WAV, just .wma and MP3. Even though it can write in .WAV format. That's just stupid.

Plus, I hate the fact that burning a CD in WMP continues to automatically insert a pause between tracks. Apparently, Bill Gates has never heard a music album that segues, such as almost everything ever published by Frank Zappa and Trent Reznor.

VHP also has some bug issues. As confirmed on the Microsoft support site, wakening the computer from a low-power state causes digital audio drivers to malfunction. In my case, it fills my speakers with static. Three Windows Updates, including the newest one posted on 10 July 2007, have not solved this problem. I found two solutions on my own:

*I can reboot, which is annoying whenever I need to get back on the computer after an absence, such as sleeping, eating, and otherwise living my life.

*Or I can stop using digital audio altogether. Specifically by running analog cables from the speaker outputs of my computer to the multichannel inputs of my receiver, and then telling my computer's sound manager to run speaker audio as the default device. Since *Half-Life 2* only supports analog surround sound anyways, this is no real loss. Except I think it is stupid that a game will happily use stereo cables to support my 5.1 setup, but refuses to use my digital cable for anything except stereo!

->THE BOTTOM LINE<-

Vista is ideal for some and excessive for others.

XP with SP2 is still a current and capable OS, with a third service pack on the way. Microsoft will continue mainstream support until about 2009. So after spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on XP compatible software, you might as well get your money's worth and keep using it. Especially since Vista's successor is already in the works, XP users can safely wait a couple more years.

This is true even for security-minded users. The new account restrictions are appropriate for an actual network that can be accessed by multiple people. You will still need a third party anti-virus and spyware program. For everybody else, XP with Service Pack 2 and regular updates will protect your Jenna Jameson pics and household budgets just fine.

Likewise, those who are serious about media will not need Vista's limited programs. You `ll be looking for more capable products from third party vendors, such as Nero, Paint Shop Pro, or Final Cut. Bleeding-edge gamers and graphic artists will likely appreciate the increased graphics capability, especially since a handful of DX10 games are due this fall, but like physics cards, I wouldn't consider this a must-have tech until 2008.

However, those who are buying their first computer, or who need to replace a much older OS, will benefit from the change in just about every respect: from stability to out-of-the-box capability. You will lose support for some old programs, especially those written before 2002, but those probably need to be replaced anyways. Vista also requires considerably more memory and hard drive space, so those running an older OS are probably in a position to require a hardware upgrade as well.

Finally, Vista Home Premium is ideal for those who want to get their 21st Century Geek on, especially when coupled with a multimedia, high-framerate, high-def death rig. Rrrr! I'm a truck! (Sorry, I just had to throw in a Wildman Fisher reference).

Partitioning your hard drive with this program is as simple as specifying how much space you want and where that space is to come from. You can even let PartitionMagic change drive references for you if necessary! That little feature saves time and a lot of frustration! Need to resize a partition that is already created? No problem, select resize specify how you want it resized, let the system reboot and you're in business.
You can convert partitions from one type (say FAT32) to another (NTFS) especially useful if you upgraded to XP and kept your old FAT file system. This action is performed well...
You can also check partitions for errors using this program, although you can do just as well using Windows included utilities.
The price is kinda steep, but would you want to risk your data with a cheap piece of software? I have used this software numerous times, on numerous machines, and have had minimal errors.

B004RPUJ78,,5,"LT is the ""light"" version of AutoCAD.  The main difference, is that it doesn't allow for 3D modeling.  If you only need 2D modeling capability, it is a very viable alternative to the much more expensive full version of AutoCAD 2012.  I've used both AutoCAD 2012 and AutoCAD 2011, and for the most part, they are a very effective way to add some power to your drafting, especially when you combine it with a lower-cost 3D modeling solution, of which there are many. I don't have to do much 3D design anymore, but when I do, I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelCAD/dp/B004XO6V1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelCAD</a>.

Install was pretty easy and although I have previous experience with AutoCAD, the layout is simple enough where first-timers can jump right in fairly quickly with minimal experience. I did experience some crashing and locking up however.  I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is.  I installed it separately on two different workstations and both had the same issues.  It didn't happen enough for me to change my rating on the product, but it is still pretty annoying. There are not too many visual differences between it and AutoCAD 2011.  I hate the Dashboard ribbon, but fortunately you can get around this by selecting ""AutoCAD Classic Workspace.""  I find that things also run much more smoothly by turning off Autocomplete and Dynamic Input.  There is a lot of room for customization within the program and you can set things up pretty much any way that is most convenient to you.

I started out doing some simple designs of my office's data flow, and drafted some plans of our office structure. Doing a data flow diagram, I tend to use the copy function a lot.  AutoCAD 2012 has a lot more features and copy options now that made this much easier to accomplish, including cleanup tools like the ability to merge duplicate objects and removed nested objects that share the same geometry, which it will recognize as unnecessary. Some of my diagrams can get fairly complicated and squashed together, so this is definitely a plus and made things easier.  I will upload a copy of the diagram I was able to complete in the customer images section.

Overall, I think that AutoCAD may be following in Adobe's footsteps and starting to create ""bloatware"" by trying to add too many features and visual aspects, like unnecessary toolbars to their products, so I hope it doesn't continue with AutoCAD 2013.  But if you're looking for a budget 2D drafting option and still want the option to exchange formats with those using the full CAD software, AutoCAD 2012 is the way to go.

B004E9SKFA,,4,"Microsoft Office 2007 was a radical departure from the previous versions of Office:  it introduced an XML-based file format that changed files like "".doc"" and "".xls""  to "".docx"" and "".xlsx"".  More importantly, it heavily modified the user interface, changing the old way of menus to the new ""Ribbon Control"" with tabs and context-sensitive icons.

This is the Professional version of Office:  it contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access and Publisher.  The Home & Business Edition subtracts Publisher and Access and the Home Edition further subtracts Outlook.

Dude, Where's my Stuff?
While Office 2010 isn't as radical a departure as 2007 was, it is definitely different.  Users who have just gotten used to the Ribbon Control may be exasperated to find that once again features have been moved.  Gone is the circular ""Office"" button that used to be your access point for things like saving and printing--the ""File"" menu is back...but not quite.  The User Interface has been tweaked to provide more visible work surface, and yet there are now tabs in the ribbon that completely hide the work surface.  For example, the ""File"" menu will open a web-page-style layout that covers the entire window:  it offers basic menu items on the left, some large-button categorical options in the middle, and then refreshes the huge space on the right with large buttons for the basic features.  Instead of menus and sub-menus it is now more like navigating a web site.
Then there's the verbiage.  For example, ""Send...as e-mail attachment"" is now performed by choosing ""Save & Send"" on the left, then ""Send Using E-mail"" in the middle, and ""Send as Attachment"" on the right.
After a little bit of time looking at the Office 2010 Ribbon and Menus, you'll start to understand exactly what's been done to Office this time around.  Microsoft have added a huge ton of features, and then tried to put all of those as close to the navigation surface as possible.  In other words, you'll no longer be clicking *deep* into the menus, you'll be making one or two clicks and then looking at all the options that are dumped on your screen to pick which one you'll be using.  To make matters more confusing, some options (such as ""Save"" or ""Open"") drop you off the File Menu, give you the typical Open/Save dialog box you are used to, and then automatically select the ""Insert"" tab and show you the work surface before you finish making your selection.  It can get very distracting.

Return of the Feature Creep
In the past whenever Office bolted on new items (such as blogging), the typical way of dealing with it was to give you toolbars that you could show, hide, and drag around to arrange at the top of your screen.  Now what we have is:
- Tab names at the top that come and go based on what you're doing (like Office 2007)
- Changes to the workspace based on which tab you've selected
- A File Menu that is no longer a candy-like button but is another tab on the ribbon...and yet it drops every possible option onto the screen and trusts you to navigate through them.

Tuned and Tweaked
That said, Microsoft have done something under the covers that has been a blessing and a curse.  On the one hand, your programs will load lightning-quick.  On the other, if you try to keep two installations of Office on the same machine, what is supposed to work will instead work unevenly:  Word and Excel will let you open both versions, but my installations of Outlook and Project completely blocked my ability to launch the 2007 versions (despite repeatedly indicating otherwise during installation and configuration).

Future Forecast:  Bright, but Cloudy
The other feature Office 2010 places more at the forefront is the idea of The Cloud.  In Office-Speak, this means using the Internet to keep documents synced in real-time no matter where you go.  If you remember Windows Briefcase, this is everything the Briefcase should have been.  If you ever tried the File Sync Wizard, Windows Sharing and Synchronization, or ActiveSync, this is like an invisible, hands-free version of that.  There's good and bad about this and you want to be aware of what it entails before you get involved.  For example, you can create a new file and choose ""Store on Web"" or ""Save to Web"".  When you do this, you will be prompted to choose the location.  If that location is a Windows Live account, then you'll want to pay attention to whether you are saving to a private folder or a public one.  From that point forward, any time you open the document on any machine it can fetch the latest version from the web.  If you don't want your document to sync automatically it can also be done manually.

If you're used to Microsoft Office 2007, you will be impressed with Office 2010's addition of features and its performance as a program.  Expect to be frustrated from time to time when something appears to have `moved'.  If you're new to the revised Office system of 2007 and 2010, it is a complete look-and-feel overhaul and you will want to spend some time getting to know it.","12 2, 2010",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,Trenton Bennett,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},"Bigger, Not Always Better",1291248000,False,8,Software

I have found Spy Sweeper to be robust and to consistently catch more spyware traces than any other product, though I believe it's wise to use multiple products for the best possible protection.

B00BFNCFZ4,,5," Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X6 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X6 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X5 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X6.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X5 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X6 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X5 and VideoStudio X6, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X6's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X6 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD (including new AVCHD 2.0 support in X6), WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X6 version has pretty decent 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X6; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X6.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X6 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X6 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X6 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.","07 18, 2013",A24HWYHR28JJ7A,AmazonCustomer,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},Powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities; need patience to learn all of its features.,1374105600,False,,Software

Playback video quality seems to be excellent. At 1080p resolution I haven't noticed any quality difference from that of other media suites. The pictures are clear, crisp, and the colors are what you'd expect them to be.

Audio playback was less than stellar at default setting. By default, the audio decoding is handled by PowerDVD and frankly, when sending audio to my AVR via HDMI, it did a horrible job of separating the audio channels. The center channel was practically ignored and audio was sent to the front left and right channels instead. To fix this issue, I went into the audio settings and set PowerDVD to send non-decoded audio to my AVR instead of letting PowerDVD decode it. This way, my AVR was able to properly decode the HDMI audio signals and send them to the proper speakers. Audio sounded perfect after that.

First run of this program was less than confidence inspiring. As it worked to build the media library, which took nearly 8 hours to complete, the PowerDVD program would become unresponsive and freeze up extended periods. Once the media library had been built, the program has run smoothly and stably since.

Overall I'm very happy with this suite, and it does a better job than Windows Media Center for Windows 8.1 Pro, which tends to be buggy and not want to play various media sources without computer restarts and other nonsense.

B002JB3CUS,,4,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I am a complete newbie to PaperPort; this is the first time I have tired the program.  As such, I initially found myself overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things I could do with my documents, be they existing and newly created/scanned. However, after spending some time with the tutorials, I started to get the hang of things.

Here is my experience with Paperport 12:

WHAT IT IS:
Paperport is ""document management software.""  It's not just scanning, or  OCR, or PDF software; it's everything you thought you could do with your documents and photos, and then some.  The program is aimed towards users with knowledge of scanning and editing, and for the most part, assumes you already have basic understanding/familiarity with this.

WHAT IT DOES:
* Scans Documents
* Views and Edits PDF Files
* Edits and Enhances Images
* Organizes Files
* Assembles Documents
* Searches for Items
* Add Notes
* Handles Forms

OBSERVATIONS:
* I installed Paperport 12 on my Windows 7 Pro (64-bit) computer, and it runs perfectly.

* There is a downloadable scanner database that works with Paperport, and you may or may not need to troubleshoot your scanner to get it to work.  My scanner is an Epson V300, and I was able to get this to work from within Paperport after downloading the database and running the troubleshooter.

* You can scan your documents, page by page, and add them to ""stacks"" of pages, which then can be turned into a searchable PDF file.  You can also stack existing documents and turn those into PDF files for sharing.  Paperport comes with a full PDF editor, which allows you to add photos, forms, etc to your PDF documents.

* Paperport uses ""OmniPage"" as the OCR engine.  However, to use OCR, you first have to make a searchable PDF.  I was unable to get this feature to work with my test page.  Back to the tutorials!

* The program uses a ""ribbon"" style toolbar (as seen in Microsoft Office) so if you are not familiar with the ribbon toolbar, (like me!) then you might be a bit lost at first.

CONCLUSION:
If you've used previous versions of Paperport (or something similar) in the past, then you will probably have no trouble navigating the mountain of menus on the ribbon toolbar.  I know that as a beginner, I have only scratched the surface of what Paperport can do, but so far I like what I see.  I look forward to taming the clutter . . . after spending more time with the tutorials.  Because Paperport 12 is not beginner friendly, but has such great potential if you take the time to learn it, I am rating this product 4 out of 5 stars.","11 2, 2010",A20DDH4NT6Q1E8,Koala1356,,Document clutter has met its match!,1288656000,False,,Software

There is a couple of ways you can have it set up, but they are all easily switch able between Windows and Mac. I have it set up so everything stayed together. You can for the most part keep Windows in a window of it's own or you can have it in something called ""Coherence"", which has the windows version of the dock on the bottom. But it is easy to go between the windows and mac.

B00BFNCFXG,,5,"I used both VideoStudio x4 and x5 and found them easier to work with (and less error prone) than products I'd used from Roxio and Pinnacle.

Corel keeps improving this software, adding more and more functionality and tools that work with today's HD formats.  Now you can implement motion tracking.  You just move the pointer to the object you want to track.  Pretty simple.

You can do stop motion shooting.  You can manipulate files recorded in the latest 4K ultra HD standards.  You can speed up and slow down the video to add dramatic effect.  Adding clips and transitions is a simple drag and drop process.

The program continues to be much more stable than the Roxio and Pinnacle offerings I've used in the past.  I haven't had any crashes or unduly long delays while the program tries to figure out what it's doing.

Rendering speeds are fair -- I'm running this on two machines I built, one of which has an AMD 1100T hexcore processor and the other with an Intel i7-3770k.  Both systems have discrete graphics cards, and Corel has optimized the code so it can take advantage of both the CPU and GPU when rendering.

Over all, this is one of the simplest and most powerful video editing programs I've used.  It has incredible power and flexibility, especially at this price point.  Check it out.","05 15, 2013",A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW,A. H.,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},Corel keeps improving this title,1368576000,False,2,Software

This is the best accounting software I've tried. Whether you run a small business or something very tiny out of your home, Sage is worth it.

Pros:
-Easy to set up, use, and learn. Obviously learning comes easier if you have an accounting or reporting background.
-Runs smoothly and without error after a few weeks of use.

B015PIIF80,,5,"This day and age  many people have a lot of different devices for recording video. I, myself have a number, including two cell phones, and ipod touch and ipad, several android devices (including a few Amazon Fire tablets), a dash-cam in my car, and a couple of the small action cameras. Not to mention some regular style camcorders and a digital point-and-shoot camera that can take videos. I was given a drone for Christmas that had a video camera  but it now lives in the top of a tree somewhere in a Louisiana bayou (story for another time). Plus, I'm slowly working on transferring old VHS tapes to digital format. So I was happy to try out this new version of Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 for the past thirty days. I've been using an older version of similar software from another brand (Corel VideoStudio Pro X3) and wanted to tryout something newer.

Installation was typical for a software package like this, and you need to activate the software and register it at the company's website (you'll need to set up an user account). The package also comes with a code that gets you some bonus content. I had problems with getting that. There really isn't any clear instructions as what to do with the code. I went out to the CATOON web site and couldn't figure out where to input the code. Doing a little research I finally figured out that you had to access the website through the web portal inside the software itself. Then I had the problem of how exactly to do that  the icon/button isn't marked very clearly (IMO). But I eventually found it (upper right-hand corner of the screen, black square with the letters CO and a blue dot inside the O). Since I had already set up an account with the Catoon store all I had to do is put in the code and check out. Make sure that the amount shown is $0.00 otherwise there was something wrong with the code. At first I was a  bit underwhelmed with the downloaded content, but after taking a better look at it  I changed my mind. You get three folders of stuff,  Videos, Songs, and Sound Fx. For the video, you get ten short abstract video pieces ranging from 5~27 seconds in length. You can use these for a variety of things. Songs, you get twenty pieces of music, and for Sound FX you get forty various generic sound effects. Not a whole lot of stuff, but some pieces that might come in handy. You can look around the Catoon store while you're there and check out some of the free stuff, but be aware  there is licensing on all the content there for the specific usage of the material. Be sure to first check to see what you're agreeing to before you use something you got for free.

The Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 was easy to jump in and get started using  but then I've had experience using similar video editing packages in the past. Someone new to video editing will probably be facing a pretty steep learning-curve trying to use this software for the first time. The company has provided a fairly detailed 400 page PDF user manual to read, but my suggestion is to go online and check out the video tutorials that are available on the companys website. These short videos are more a overview of someone demonstrating many of the software's features than actual tutorials  but you do learn something from viewing them. I first worked my way through the software by having one of the videos open on one of my screens and the software up on the other, and following along as the video played. This is probably a good place to mention something that sort of irked me about the tutorial videos. There are three different versions of this video editing software available (Pro, Pro Plus, and Pro Premium). The tutorials aren't very clear as to what features are in what package (well, they sort of do, I just didn't pick up on it). So after viewing the videos before I actually got the software, I was a bit disappointed that the Pro version didn't include some of the features that I was really wanting to try out (screen capture for instance). Still, go check out the videos if you're just starting to use this software for the first time, or are considering buying it.

The interface and actual operation of the software was similar enough to what I've used in the past that I was able to get started with no problems. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, I've got a number of video device (too many really). The issue with that is there are a couple different video file formats each of those produce. But the  Movie Edit Pro can handle all of those. I'm able to import and edit everything. Some of the features I like with this new editing package are  the title / subtitle feature. I make a lot of video sideshows for people using the photographs and I found that titling images is something that a lot of people appreciate. Having the ability to choose a location for the text and changing up the look of the font is really helpful. I also like that you can choose a stock menu when you burn a project to a DVD or  Bluray.

I also have Magix's Music Maker 2016 Live on my computer, and like that the music files made with it can be directly used for this video editing package. It's great to make a custom soundtrack for a slide show in Music Maker and then simply drop it into the audio track in Movie Edit.

I could probably go on and on about the things I like with this software, but that's enough. I have to say I really enjoyed checking this out and think it will be something I'm going to keep using for awhile. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to edit the videos that they too probably have piling up on their computers and devices.

Just in case it might be helpful - I'm running this software on a five year old computer  a HP HPE-190t desktop with an i7 processor and 12GB of ram running Windows 7 Pro. I've got two monitors, a 27 and a 24 which works well as I can set the main program up on the larger screen and use the smaller one for the video pre-view window.","04 3, 2016",A34VV0DDR0OFE5,K.

Intuit has foisted yet ANOTHER outrage on the Mac user community with ANOTHER farcical release of a sub-par product. Yet ANOTHER so-called ""Quicken for Mac"" that is incompatible with and requires conversion from ANY of its own Quicken for Windows products; that lacks numerous essential features Quicken for Windows has had for years such as multiple currency capability.

Intuit has had 26 years to get it right, since the first Quicken for Mac in 1989. All they have done with their Quicken for Mac range since at least 2007 is produce the least capable of all personal finance software for Mac.

What is Intuit thinking? Do they think at all? What rational conclusion is possible from release of Quicken for Mac 2016after the debacles of Quicken Essentials and Quicken for Mac 2015than that Intuit thinks we Mac users are innumerate idiots, dupes, pushovers to have our pockets picked?

Altogether it took about 20 minutes, it was a seamless process.  If you know that you want to install on several computers / laptops all at once you're good to go.  If not, you do have an option for later installation:  ""You can always install Sage 50 on additional computers later.""  I was simply installing in on my PC, so opted for the one for now.

One other thing you'll need to consider during installation is disabling your firewall.  I chose to allow my Windows Firewall to work with Sage, but I could also have configured it manually.  There are a few things to consider when installing, but I found it to be an easy step-by-step process with no problems.  I simply closed out everything in the background and concentrated on the installation process.

Sage 50 is perfect for the individual accountant or small business bookkeeper.  Customer support has been spotty in the past and that has been their biggest downfall.  This packet comes with a full year of customer support and online updates.  What I'm seeing and want to see, is easy access for when I need help.  There's online assistance where I can ""manage a case"" by shooting off an email or can access technical support via chat.  Personally I much prefer using phone support when I have issues (866-747-3888).  The proof is in the pudding as they say and if anyone is having issues, later reviews will probably let everyone know how customer support is doing.

Learning curves are sometimes what the individual makes of them.  I'm so far liking what I see.  I was able to take a look at a sample company and could easily spot a section ""Getting Around Sage 50.""  If I can't see anything right in a program or if I have to buy an expansive book I easily become frustrated and will turn away.  Sage has everything right where I want it ... at my fingertips right in the program.  More than likely, the lengthy installation had something to do with this.  I don't want to buy a ""secrets"" sort of book nor do I want to go scouting around on the net to find out something.

I was looking at ""Show-Me-How Videos,"" ""Quick Reference Guides,"" and a list of ""Sage University Courses.""  No further expenditure was needed on my part.  I didn't have to take a pill so to speak from getting a headache looking at a mess.  Everything was laid out nicely and wasn't overwhelming.  Many of the learning areas had drop down menus with additional areas to explore.  I'm going to list what I saw as an easy-access learning menu below.

Do I think I can easily manage and work with this accounting software?  Yes.  Am I confident the company will come through with that customer support that was lacking in the past?  I'm not sure, but that remains to be seen and can't be predicted without more people weighing in.

A large array of brushes and techniques, ability to choose your canvas textures, mix and match your styles, and so much more. This is in-depth artist software that goes beyond just digital painting.

I have fallen in love with Painter X3 already from my casual artist point of view. I can pull from my past experience from other graphic and photo programs with items such as layers, cut/paste, effects, etc. and work my art as I like with paints, pencils, pens, crayons, etc.

One of the great things I appreciate with Corel is that they post tutorial videos to help a newbie get started with their software. I NEEDED this to learn my way around the canvas and see how it all worked. I also appreciate seeing the different artwork people have created using Corel Paint. It can be quite inspiring.

One feature I have enjoyed immensely right away is the ability to take your favorite photograph and create a painting from it. I learned about photo painting from Corel's website when I was learning about what Painter X3 can do. This was the fastest way for me to get started painting  and familiarize with the abundance of brushes available.  The results have been very pleasing and I still manage to translate my own unique style into the work. The first couple works were rather rough, but as I learned more of the software, the better my photo painting was becoming.

Corel Painter X3 is fantastic and can make an artist giddy with all the toys available for the user, but the price will make you giddy too.  It's unashamedly pricey, not really practical for the casual artist. But if you can afford it Painter X3 is worth looking in to.

B00B1TGQCA,,3,"NOTE:  This product is the Office Professional 2013 collection.  Check the listing here to really understand editions, as some users are accidentally purchasing the wrong one.  What you are buying here is either a 'Download' stored in your Amazon digital locker complete with license key or a 'Key Card'--plastic card with the license key printed on it that is shipped to you.  Both download and key-card involve downloading Office.

Also, Office 2013 is NOT compatible with Windows XP or Vista.  It requires you to have Windows 7 or 8.

The short form:  there were some good ideas behind the improvements to Office 2013, but poor execution, a confusing bid to sell Office 365, and licensing issues (that have since been improved) have tripped up this version of Office.  You'll survive with it on a new computer, but there aren't a lot of reasons to upgrade if you already have an existing version of Office.

The Good
If you're a long-time user of Office, there aren't a lot of incentives in Office 2013 to make you want to jump onto the bandwagon apart from the fact that it really does load faster and respond fairly snappily, even on older hardware.  The UI is another step beyond what Office 2010 did, offering a flatter-looking ribbon, more stuff dumped into the ribbon, and yet more of those full-screen interface menus that now resemble the 'Modern UI' front-end of Windows 8 and Windows Phone.  There are little pleasantries, like files flowing more seamlessly in and out of SkyDrive, and the way the cursor tracks as you type is a surprisingly nice detail.  One of the things Microsoft has been trying to do is make your Windows Live/Microsoft/Hotmail/X-Box/SkyDrive account a one-stop shop for all things Microsoft, and so if you set up Windows and/or Office to tie directly into that, little fringe benefits like the aforementioned SkyDrive are dropped into your programs.

Installation of Office 2013 is a breeze--it is surprisingly fast, in minutes if you've already downloaded the files.  It's also slightly simpler than earlier versions, getting quickly to the ""Install now/Customize"" screen.  The first step is a doozy, though:  you might start off with an Office 365 prompt that tells you to enter in the e-mail address associated with your Office install.  Pay attention to the ""I want to use a Product Key"" link on that screen:  it flips you from, ""I'm about to accidentally kick off a 90-day Office 365 Trial"" to ""I have a license key, now where do I type it in?"".  The first time I did this I thought this was about tying Office to my Microsoft account, so I went that route and ended up getting e-mails about my Office 365 Trial, how I can use Office via a browser, etc., etc.; and after the trial, then I had to go back in and properly 'Activate' office.

The Bad, Lumped In With The Ugly
Unfortunately, we then come to the 'look and feel' and that's where things start to literally get ugly.  Office 2013 has a default color palette of ""One color, black text, and white all over the place.""  There are two other color schemes, but no other way to customize the interface nor any downloadable themes.  All three options, ""White"", ""Light Gray"", and ""Dark Gray"" end up adding to the eyestrain.  The menus we lost in the Ribbon of 2007 to 2007's circular candy-button were put back in Office 2010 as colored tabs, and in 2013 they SHOUT AT YOU IN ALL CAPS.  ""FILE HOME VIEW..."" they say, and I feel like my dad just sent me an e-mail.

Because of the work I do, I often have to have two versions of Office installed at the same time.  Just like 2007 and 2010, it's possible to have a dual install, but some products are going to screw up.  My Outlook 2010 was completely removed, and MS Project (sold separately) still really hates to sit on the same machine with another version.  I now have regular licensing dust-ups, where one product or another claims that there was a problem in activating Office and starts running some sort of setup screen.  I then have to close everything, reboot, and run through activating Office again.  My fault for being weird and running two versions, but I tell you this so you know to avoid trying to keep both on the same machine--pick one or the other.

The bottom line:  if you have a new PC that came with Office 2013 or you work for an organization that makes you move to 2013, there will be times when something you just got used to in 2007 or 2010 has been changed or moved, but you will otherwise get by.  If you already have Office 2007 or 2010, there's not a huge incentive to move to 2013--the pros are outweighed by the cons.","07 17, 2013",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,Trenton Bennett,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},"Good, Just Not Enough",1374019200,False,6,Software

I would much rather have a program that can protect my system right up front.","03 15, 2012",A3BH63GKL7MQ2K,J. Roberts,,As solid as ever,1331769600,False,,Software
B000VLZCEW,,3,"I have mixed feelings about this product.  It has bailed me out from a C: disk crash.  However, I had many issues with the software (I will give examples below), support for problems is practically non existent (help only from the forums where other people are having the same issues)  and when the crash happened I had very little hope that it would work. But it did.  I now switched to a different back up method.

When I bought this software, I wanted to have a backup history of about a month so I can go back to the old files if I made some sort of mistake.  My hope was to run a full back up once a week, and then have differential backs 6 times a week, this way I could fit 7 different backups on a large disk designated for backups.  The software claims to have a function that allows it to delete old backups based on a condition (% of disk full for example).  But that never worked. Many other people complained about the same problem.  When the disk became full, it simply stopped backing up.  I had to remember to manually free up disk.

Then I upgraded to a next version of the software which was supposed to have these problems fixed.  However, the fix was to remove the functionality and what I wanted to do was not possible.  The new version still had problems with incremental backups at disk full situation.  In fact I left it double the amount of space necessary for one backup (as the forums indicated it needs temporary space while the backup is working).  Finally, the only solution that worked was to have a full back up every day, with a rule that the previous copy had to be deleted before the new backup was created.  Occasionally, it would still fail with messages that made no sense at all.  I could get it to work again sometimes, if I deleted several backups and ran disk defragmenter. But this did not always help.  And then in a few days it would begin working again.  So it felt fragile and unreliable.

As I was having various issues I contacted support several times (support is via email), they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks requesting some additional log file, to which they would respond maybe in another 2-3 weeks.  By then whatever they said was not relevant, because I could not just wait for 4-6 weeks for a possibly helpful response. I would just wipe out the backups and start all over.

Because the regular backups felt flakey, I also created ""secure zone"" back up, which is an option to have a backup on a separate partion.  When the disk crashed, restore from secure zone did not work.

So overall, using it was a very frustrating experience which was shared by a large number of other users based on the forum postings.  The forum was the only place where I could get ideas of for possible solutions, and validation that the problems I was having were not unique to me.

However there are some positive things about the product
1.  The feature that allows you to mount a back up and easily retrieve an old file as if it was just another volume is very nice
2.  The backups are fairly quick. I tried using Windows native back up and on my disks it did not even completed in 24 hours.  Acronis backup for all my disk completed overnight (when it worked), when it did not it would sit at the prompt complaining about something with inscrutable message.
3.  Finally, when the disaster struck and my c: drive crashed, I was able to do a restore my C: drive from the backup to a brand new drive and it worked.  I did not have to reinstall windows, all my settings and customization were preserved.

Bottom line, this is only for those who have no other options.  It requires constant baby-sitting.  You need to manually check if it worked on daily basis, delete files, and  just pay constant attention to it.  But what you want from a backup is to enable it and forget it until you need it.","04 20, 2011",A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,Ali Julia,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},"Bailed me out in a disaster, but needs constant baby sitting (lots of problems)",1303257600,True,,Software

0982697813,,5,"Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed.  After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.

Things glo has improved upon:

++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are ""lenses"" that ""distribute content over a zoomable interface,"" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.

++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.

++  The user can check out the ""contributors and sources"" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.

++  There is a ""Quick Install"" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.

++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.

++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.

The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this ""revolutionary new Bible"" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.

GLO features:

++  450+ Virtual Tours
  These are 360-degree tours of ""modern-day and re-created"" ancient biblical locations.""

++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos
  You'll be able to enjoy the ""In His Shoes"" HD interactive documentary.

++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos
  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.

++  7,500+ Articles
  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan

Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.

++  650+ Works of Art

++  Integration with the best web content

++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program

++  Concise, compact organization through five ""lenses""

++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study

LENSES:

BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.

TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation

MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and ""reading plans.""

MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.

ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger ""picture"" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.

TOPICAL:  Here you can ""quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.""

There are three DVDs in this packet.  You can now install it on both Windows and Mac systems.  Below are the system requirements.

Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 operating system with latest service pack installed

Duel core processor

1GB RAM for Microsoft Windows XP, or 2GB RAM for Vista or Window 7

This is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.

B0017KEA6W,,3,"There are a couple of choices when you are looking for your trip guidance and maps software/equipment.

I am going to compare Microsoft streets and maps to other choices available and let you decide if this is right for you:

Microsoft streets & trips v/s Delorome earthmate LT-40 GPS
==========================================================
While both of these come with software + hardware (GPS dongle).  I found Delorome earthmate to be better than Microsoft Streets and trips for these reasons:
(1) Better live navigation - The voice and guidance from Delorome is way better than MS streets & trps
(2) Delerome is 3D presentation while MS streets & trips is just 2d presentation
(3) Delerome costs $39 while ms streets & trips cost $54 - at the time of this review

Microsoft streets & trips v/s Online maps - google, yahoo, MS live
==========================================================
(1) Good - MS Streets is way faster than any of the online maps
(2) Good - MS streets does not need internet connection unlike online maps - literally works everywhere
(3) Bad - MS streets & trips requires you to upgrade every year for updated map information and POI (points of interests) such as restaurants, gas stations, while online maps do not need you to subscribe to any updates
(4) Bad - Online versions contain street view (in google), birds eye view in (MS live) and satellite view (in all online maps) while MS streets and trips does not contain any photography

Microsoft streets & trips v/s Portable GPS units (Garmin/Tom-Tom) ...
==========================================================
(1) Good - MS streets & trips can be viewed on a larger screen on your laptop v/s tiny screens on a portable GPS units
(2) Good - MS streets & trips costs much lower than portable GPS units
(3) Bad - Portable GPS units are far more portable, easy to view(can be fixed on the windshield) compared to MS streets and trips
(4) Bad - Portable GPS units are more user friendly with easy to navigate interface and touch screens while MS Streets and trips requires use of computer keys which can be distracting as well as cumbersome

Safety concerns:
================
Lastly I have a few safety concerns about using this product on your laptop while driving
(1) Unless your laptop is fixed well into the car - it can be flying object hazard.  If your car/truck stops all of a sudden, the laptop can be a projectile and hit the person in the passenger seat/rear seat

(2) Never drive and navigate on this software on your laptop sitting on a passenger seat - I have done that and let me tell you that it can be very distracting.  Even a few seconds off the road can mean something serious.

Tips:
======
If you are going to buy this product, I would suggest that you also get yourself a car invertor - a unit that converts your automobile 12V DC to 110v AC.

Photo Director Six, however, is more sophisticated and gives new ways to enhance and manage your photos. The user interface hasn't changed much. If you're familiar with Photo Director Five it's basically the same: a large window for your photo, editing tools run down the left side, and thumbnails of your photos for editing across the bottom.

The installation and registration went smoothly. I use the Windows version for Windows 7, but it also works on Mac.

The new tools I particularly like are body shaper, face swap, and the ability to remove unwanted figures from the photo. Body shaper is great fun. It allows you to pull in the outline of a figure, an easy way to lose fifty pounds. The face swap is handy for selecting the best facial expressions for a group photo from several versions of the picture. Being able to remove unwanted from your photo is a great way to clean up the background.

The slide show is easy to set up, just drag the photos from the thumbnail list at the bottom into the picture section above. You can sequence them any way you want. My only criticism is that it's a very basic slide show. Cyberlink Power Director has more interesting slide shows. However, this slide show is adequate to display your photos.

My favorite feature of the Cyberlink products is the extensive presets that can be used to give your pictures different HDR effects, enhance the scenery, change skin tone, and a number of others. Additional presets can be downloaded from Cyberlink.

Photo Director Six is a useful tool for editing photos and relatively inexpensive. I recommend it for quick editing.

However, I have to say that I was a lot more impressed with this than I was ever with 2009. Bitdefender 2009 brought me nothing but heartache and brought my computer down because of different incompatibility issues with other software.

The installation of 2010 was very easy and it had even let me keep using my 2009 key if I wanted to. I had installed this on three different Operating Systems: two running Windows 7 and one running Windows XP. The first Windows 7 installation did encounter some problems but I was able to let it do a scan of my computer and then re-installed and it worked fine. The Windows XP one had the 2009 version on it and it went very fast without any problems. I had found that after installing 2010 on the Windows XP, that I had a lot less bugs than before. However, since my computer was just bogged down with too much applications and files on it, I did a new install of Windows 7. With the newest Windows 7, I installed 2010 and again, no problems whatsoever. It was smooth and ran very fast. In fact, I barely notice the antivirus running.

The backup is very easy to setup. Just note that the online backup is only for a limited amount of time. I believe it is for one year. All of the other features work great and the new look is so much better than before. It's less bulky and more attractive.

(Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)

That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:

First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.

I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).

All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.

I don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.

Also, none of the forms were usable ""as-is"" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).

Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.","01 26, 2012",A1HOLE9R6WPT85,Mad Max,"{'Format:': ' Box', 'Platform:': ' PC Disc'}","Really for individuals & small business ...

B00N4OLGL6,,4,"This gets 4 stars because of my particular exposure to much more expensive products, but if this was my first editing program, it would get 5 stars.

I have experience with a few products, including Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere, so this review is done with those products in mind.

Once installed, the first task I tried was to create a photo slideshow using one of the styles provided in the quick editor. Initially, I was impressed by the software's ability to work with Raw files, however, this doesn't use the exits stored in the .xmp data made in Adobe Bridge. This means they are straight out of camera without any edits, so it's better to work with processed jpgs. Personally speaking, this is quite sad, because it processes the jpgs out of the raw at an incredible speed.

Once you have selected the right style for your video, it will process your images into the template with accompanying music.

When that is finished you can preview it, and if you like how everything is arranged, you can go straight from there to produce the video, and from there to upload or share.

If your video needs refinement, you can open the video in the template editor. This allows you to change titles, etc. if they were a part of the template you selected.

Once the template driven video has been created, it will either output this to a final file or you can edit in advanced editing mode. Here you will have the initial creation as a clip, from where you can add elements before or after the clip to fully flesh out your video.

Pros
Very feature rich for the price
Absolutely superb for entry level users
Very similar layout to most video editing tools, so most features are where you might expect them
The ability to create final products using the templates is better than similar offerings from other video editing software.
Output options include seamless uploading to your YouTube or similar accounts, once the video has been rendered.
Comes with audio editor

Cons
When using the templates in the easy editor or the slideshow creator, it would be much better to be able to see an example of that template before importing your images into it to preview - maybe a mouse-over effect in the style thumbnail area.
Once a clip has been created  through the quick editor, and brought into the main timeline for advanced editing, I do not see a way to make further edits to that clip -- like rearranging the order of stills in a slide show, reducing the audio level of the bundled sound with that style, etc.
Since so many of the tools in this software look so similar to programs like Premiere, etc. it would be wonderful to have similar functionality like layer opacity easily accessible for editing. It may be possible to edit the opacity of a video layer in Power Director 13, but I can't find it, and that was after checking the help file.

It just crashed on me while I was moving the marker along the timeline, so I lost what I was working on....

When your edits are final and you want to produce the video, you can choose from standard 2D, 3D, Device or Online, but to the novice user, it is not obvious which type is best suited to email a video to a friend.

Summary - great for home user who is looking for something better than the simple products that only let you choose from templates. Because this has templates and advanced options, you can get more creative as your skill and inspiration increase. Most likely there are way more features and options than the average user will use, but that increases its appeal to a broader audience.","11 24, 2014",A3M7BCQKSQAK4L,A Family Effort,,Very feature rich for entry level and semi-experienced editors,1416787200,False,,Software

B001VGZLQ0,,2,"I chose this from my Vine list mainly for the photo paint shop. I have the Corel Paint Shop Pro XI and liked it in my old Dell Optiplex desk top with Windows XP but it doesn't want to run right on my new Dell Studio 17 with the Windows Vista. I thought since this was a newer program it would work better than the old one does with Vista. Wrong.

It took for ever to install it. There must be something with the Windows Vista that isn't compatible with this program. I've only got it to open, after several minutes, a couple of times. The first time I got it to open it started scanning my hard drive collecting or importing all photo files, all video files, and all music files on the hard drive. It did this without my permission and there was no way that I could stop it. It should have let me choose what photo files and video files that I want to import. I definitely do not like a program taking control of my computer. It also used up just over a Gig of my hard drive with over 20,000 files in over 2000 folders.

The few times that I've got it to run the Photo Paint Shop I haven't been able to save much of what I've used it for. The program usually stalls out and won't respond right in the middle of working on a photo loosing what work had been done. Then the only way that I can get it to shut down is opening the Task Manager and forcing it to shut down. What little that I have been able to use this program has been way over simplified actually reducing the usefulness of it and what it can do. So even if I could get it to run right there isn't anything that it can do better, or even as good as my other photo programs that were a lot cheaper than the price on this one. My Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10 is still the one that I use the most out of all the ones that I have. I haven't tried to use any of the video part of this program yet so I can't say much about it. But if its like the photo part it probably won't work right for me either.

So any who, I don't know if it's in this program or in the Vista on my lap top, it won't work for me. It probably will work with XP but I don't know and I don't have enough space on the hard drive of my old desk top to try it in that one. So if it works for you, great. But if you are running Vista on your computer I suggest that you try something else.","11 12, 2009",A19GSC3QMK694Q,COLORADO HERMIT,,Not impressed with this ones performance,1257984000,False,2,Software

I'd come across a missed receipt and erase and change numbers on two different forms and three different pages. It was hard work and took a very long time.

This program makes that process easy. Find an extra $40 receipt? Add $40 to one place and all the things that need to change update through your return.

But the real strength are the wizards that take you through more complicated deductions. Rather than reading lots of instructions for line after line, this software asks you for the correct set of numbers, you supply them ... done.

B00MYXTCIM,,3,"There have been a lot of reviews here with folks unhappy about the changes to Deluxe forcing them to pay more for Premiere. If you have your own small business, you've already been using Home and Business in the past so like me, you're not going to see any changes since this is the highest tier edition anyway. As of this review, the pricing also looks to be a little less than last year for Home and Business. I can't speak to the Deluxe and all that's going on with that since I don't use Deluxe so this review will not be about that but focus on my experiences with TurboTax (TT) this year versus years past.

It seems like every time I open the application, there's an update so as is typical in January/Feburary before most people get all their W-2s, etc., there are still a lot of changes and updates going on. It seems like most of the changes are to the state part. One annoying thing on startup is it continues to insist I fill in my name, address, phone, etc. and take a two question survey. This seems to be so they can send me marketing information. They already have all this information and already send me spam, so why keep asking for it and then when I decline ask me again and again?

If you used Home and Business last year, you really won't notice anything different to start. The processes are all the same. You can import your tax return from last year and it will pre-populate all of your information and then take your through the information to review it. You can then start with your business income and expenses. For the most part, the business part seems to be the same.

One thing TT2014 seems to do better this year than in past year is importing from institutions. It was able to find the forms at my semi-obscure bank and my Fidelity workplace accounts.

The personal income part had one very annoying change from previous versions and that's to do with ISOs (Incentive Stock Options). In the past, when going through stock transactions, it would ask if the transaction was a stock exercise and then take you through a different process to find the basis. When options are exercised, if they are a disqualifying disposition (i.e. you buy/sell at the same time), the gain on the sale is reported as compensation on your W-2 so the cost basis needs to be calculated differently. This year however, for the first time since I have been using TT (1999?) this process is gone. It no longer asks if this is a ISO sale and walk you through the cost basis. You have to know how to do it on your own. I have no idea why they took this out of TT. Luckily, my company provides this information so it's easy to substitute it for what's on the 1099-B but if you're seeing this for the first time, it will be confusing and likely lead to the income being counted twice.

As always, the state return is a pain. I live in one state with no income-tax (NH) but I have some income from another state that does (MA). This year luckily it's just last year's refund. TT insists on providing MA with all of my business income forms even though that business is in NH, even when I tell TT that income is not in MA it still wants to submit all those forms to that state. This year I have no W-2 income in that state but in years past TT always screws that up by taking the W-2 information from the wrong box (it says Box 1 or Box 16 on the MA PY/NR form and TT takes from Box 1 which is incorrect since the state income is reported in Box 16). So, that means I had to override and inevitably get a letter from the MA DOR saying there's an issue with the submission. I reported this bug years ago. Crickets.

But, it's the devil I know, not the devil I don't so I keep using TT year after year and I probably will next year.

I'm a photographer and also a website designer which causes me to be on the PC often. As far as Microsoft Windows goes, I really liked XP and also Windows 7. However I found Vista to be hell. My present PC came with Windows 8 and it's 'different'; takes some getting used to. But after a while I got into the groove and I haven't any complaints. There are some, though, who just find it a mite difficult to adjust to changes. They've opted for programs that are available to retrograde Windows 7 features. If you fall into that category you might just wait a few months for Microsoft's Windows 10 to make it's debut. I understand it will include features that Windows 7 users miss.

After the first night, I realized I didn't toss and turn as much because I was worried about previous reviews that said if I did that, I'd probably destroy the sleep sack. However, in my effort to remain still, I didn't sleep well at all, and was one cranky irritable man the next morning. The next night I let myself go and was able to sleep as normal. It was weird being confined to such a small space, and I slept poorly and but I didn't notice any tears or weird damage to the bag.

B008V1LP1S,,5,"I was looking for a good pair of trekking poles for my first weeklong backpacking trip after 3 knee surgeries and having tried several other poles I wanted something that I could fold up and store in my car or in my pack.  These poles fit all my criteria.  Lightweight, reasonably priced, easy to use with no twist tightening mechanisms and adjustable.  Right out of the box it was easy to use.  They come with large and small baskets so you can use them in the summer for hiking and winter for show shoeing or possibly skiing.  They also come with carbide tips or rubber tips.  The tips are easy to change out.  Use the rubber tips when hiking on solid surfaces such as paved trail or places where marking up the surface is not desirable, like national parks and monuments.  Use the carbide tips in areas where getting a little bit better of a perch is needed like snow and ice.  The poles have comfortable grips and very nicely padded wrist straps that are adjustable.  There is a button you push to release the poles to fold them up, it's kinda small, but you just push it and slide the pole into the handle a few inches and that gives you enough slack to fold the poles up.  A nice lever is used to loosen the pole to adjust from 105 to 120 cm.  I'm a big guy and leaned on these quite a bit during the week long hike, and they held up great.

My knees are still bad and going down hill is much more painful than going uphill.  I found the grips and the wrist straps to made to allow me to transition from normal hiking to sliding my hands to the top of the poles to steady myself and take pressure off my knees when stepping down on the downhill.  They were very handy for muddy parts of the trail and gave me extra stability during rocky portions.  I look forward to using them on every hike in the future.

Pros:
- Sturdy
- Easy to extend and fold
- One of the smallest folding poles available
- Variable length from 105 cm to 120 cm
- Well padded wrist strap and grip
- Two types of baskets and tips to choose from
- Black Diamond brand is easy to find replacement parts for and have a great guarantee.
- Price.  Very well priced for this product and quality compared to other pole and materials.
- Poles do help with taking the impact off the knees.

Cons:
- Weight.  18.15 oz. Although this is not much of a con there are lighter poles made from carbon fiber, but the cost goes up.  These poles are aluminum.  6 days of carrying poles and you are ready to stash them in your pack, but I toned up my arms a bit.
- Blister from the wrist straps.  The way they are designed they do soak up sweat and that is what caused some hat spot issues on my hands and wrist.","08 28, 2014",AQPGVFRAWYFTS,Dave McGhee,{'Size:': ' 125cm'},Best set of poles I've ever used!,1409184000,True,8,Sports_and_Outdoors

B0136KVDLK,,3,"Lawn Darts aka Jarts was a popular lawn game until the early 1970s. Exaggerated replicas of the ones used with dartboards, lawn darts had heavy metal spiked ends sharp enough to pierce through sod and, unfortunately, feet, heads and hands. After being banned in the U.S. from being sold as a toy, safer versions were later marketed.

Franklin Sports Glomax Darts Light Up Soft Toss is a take off on that safer version, modernized with battery powered lights in the ball ends, making the game playable in the dark as well as light. These darts are nicely balanced and heavy enough to be tossed with some degree of accuracy. The scoring rings are modular so that one big ring or two or three smaller can be assembled. Unlike the darts, they aren't battery powered, but will glow in the dark if first left in the sun to charge.

It was raining, so we opened the box to set up the Glomax Darts game inside. It was a bit of a let down to find the blue darts dead, only the two green darts lit up. It wasn't a huge deal that effected play since the blue were still visible even with the lights off. I couldn't get the hallway completely dark so the ring pieces were also visible without having been charged in the sun to glow.

I'm torn because I know it's a game that kids and adults could enjoy. The lights are a huge plus for me. Summer nights in the backyard or at the beach, it'd be great to extend play time when sunshine wanes. On the other hand, I see from other reviews that my dead battery issue isn't a fluke. A majority of reviewers report at least one dart not lighting. I find it hard to highly recommend the Franklin Sports Glomax Darts Light Up Soft Toss knowing that, after shelling out the money to buy it, the chances are good that more dollars will have to immediately be spent on batteries.

I'll mention too that the shipping box was almost pristine, but the game box inside was beat up. I'd be embarrassed if I'd ordered it as a gift. The recipient would think I'd sent a used game with its scratched, dented box and already dead batteries.

I do have two minor complaints though. #1 is that owners manual was included. The instructions weren't completely user friendly. #2 is from the fact that the bottom T bar that holds your legs into the foot holds. The hole that was drilled to assemble that was drilled about 1/2 inch too low so it wouldn't actually attach to the unit. My husband had to hand drill another hole so we can use it. That's a pretty big component to the inversion capabilities and without it, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing inversions- which was the biggest selling point of this unit. We thought about returning it as that is rather an important fault but with the shipping taking as long as it did, we didn't want to mess with it.

All in all, this is a great unit. Made well and very sturdy. It's easy to use and assembly wasn't too painful but did take about 15 minutes. It's fairly heavy but folds up nicely.

Happily, these Irwin pliers are up for the job. The teeth get a good solid grasp and the longer handle gives comfort and ease of use from two different positions: close up for grip and further back for leverage. They have a solid heft and a comfortable, wrapped handle that makes working with them over the long period of time necessary for this task a pleasure. Of course, they are also more than up to the job of standard household usage and more: this is a construction-grade tool intended to help with electrical work.

B001QOGMAG,,4,"1) Detection: 70PPM = 60-240min, 150PPM = 10-50min, 400PPM = 4-15 min. The detection on this unit has accuracy of +/-30% in ideal conditions so don't falsely believe you're getting precision measurement ever. (Not that this unit is not particulary inaccurate compared to others, it's just the way CO detection goes in such units). You should know that as low as 30PPM are apparently harmful for kids/elderly, but there's a reason why this unit isn't that sensitive. This is a UL cert unit. UL certified units won't bark at less than 30PPM because of sensitivity/false alarms standards. That means it's not overly sensitive and simply good for healthy adults.

2) Competition: Only one other option really exists. First Alert, same price & features:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO410-Battery-Powered-Carbon-Monoxide-Alarm-with-Digital-Display/dp/B000OCSAUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO410 Battery Powered Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Digital Display</a>&nbsp;It's reviewed poorly and not really a valid choice at this point (early 2012) due to quality/bugs. If this is the feature set you want, go with the Kidde no contest. Nighthawk line also have a good reputation and good consumer reports reviews. (Don't rule out First Alert for smoke detectors though... they have some good models there.)

3) You'll actually receive model ""KN-COPP-B-LP"", not ""KN-COPP-B-LS"". That's because the LP (long life) replaced the LS (no longer made). Some reviews complain about the subtle differences, and I notice the amazon page still has references to the LS model in product description and product specification sections.

4) Mounting: Saw a review saying it should be mounted low. This is incorrect. Manual advises ""eye-level"" as optimum, and table top as an option. Carbon Monoxide/CO is slightly lighter than air, but mixes well.. so high=good. If you need to know more, both the data sheet and the owners manual are available on Kidde's website.

6) Network Considerations: Some people with multiple story houses like to have all the alarms networked (wirelessly or other) so they all go off at once. No such feature here, and when looking for wirelessly linked you are always stuck with buying alarms all of one brand/model/series so remember that. Also, unless you have a room/basement far away that you can't hear the screeching from you probably don't want them networked as it will prevent you diagnosing the problem's location and what to do (e.g. fire alarm going off in a certain room would let you rush to/away that location without slowing to check each doorknob vs. all going off at once and being disoriented about which direction to run after being suddenly awoken at 2AM.)

7) LCD Monitor: I want it. You want it. But admit to yourself this is really just a nice to have that gives you confidence it's working right. From a practical standpoint this isn't much more than a gimmick. Again you're talking plus or minus 30% accuracy (e.g. 100PPM could be 70PPM or 130PPM).  These are alarms, not monitors. About all you can/should count on for any such unit is an alarm when unquestionably deadly circumstances exist, not chronic unhealthy levels or some such.","02 8, 2012",ABIB0DRRDLN7P,Some Average Guy,,Best of Battery + LCD choices,1328659200,True,20,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

Most people who have a central ""Heating and Cooling"" system, must regulary, replace the air filters.

refered to as, MERV. This is a very effective way of informing consumers about the air filter's ability to remove and retain, air borne particulates from the air, being pulled through the heating and cooling system.

B0018MVZJE,,4,"I just received this filter.  It's replacing an older one I've had for a long time.  I like this filter, like that you can get filters for it, even though from what I read here it's kind of tough to change it out, and it does make a difference in the water taste. The water I have tastes awful, but this makes the water taste really clean.  No weird after taste.  It sits out the way in the corner of the sink.  I could see this thing breaking if it fell into the sink like my last one did, so I have it in the corner less likely to be accidently knocked down.  My only problem with it is that it leaks.  Leaked the first time I used it and I see where it's leaking from, the edge around where you would take it apart to replace the filter.  I did buy an extra filter for it and will see if I can fix this when I change it out, but for now it's a problem, but not a bad one.  I can put up with it.  I'm hoping it doesn't get worse.  Other than that I do like and recommend it but it has its flaws.  I think that has to do with its price.  A good price for a water filter.

UPDATE: I changed the filter on this and was surprised at how easy it was. I did purchase one of the filter removers, but didn't need it. The unit unscrewed easily and I was able to change it out with no problems.  Not sure if they fixed this problem, or mine just came this way.  I also noticed there is no leaking after changing the filter.  I am VERY happy with this filter and give it the 5 ***** it deserves.","08 6, 2012",A3H11LJ6EZI92N,Yvonne Graf,,Nice filter except for one problem...,1344211200,True,,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

Fortunately I have a Made in USA tap and die set with a 10mm X 1.5 die and tap. I am debating whether I should spend the time to rebuild these new poorly crafted units or just send them back. One unit has over sized end rubber caps that were loose in the box and will not stay on the end of the rod. I do not recommend buying these unless you have a good tap and die set and want to do what the manufacturer should have done in the first place.

Without the ability to do this one doesn't have a realistic chance of winning, particularly if one is playing against multiple opponents.

My six-year-old son loves science and all things technical. This was great for him. He's very patient and task-oriented... but I think many other kids his age might get a little bored with the experiments. I think age 8 would probably be a safe bet for many. He also definitely needed my help.

PROS:
- educational: lots of kid-friendly explanations included that also (cough) may educate the parents.
- fun: he really enjoyed all the experiments. I don't think he would have gotten the learning experience without aid, but would have thought it was cool no matter what.
- high quality: this is definitely a step above similar (though less expensive) kits I've seen at Target.

CONS:
- The price: forty bucks seems a bit steep. For that price, I feel like it should have a whole lab with beakers and slides and tubes! Can't quite reconcile the cost...
- Supervision needed: the most enjoyable sets to me are the ones my son can go explore entirely on his own. He can read and is fairly resourceful, so it's not out of the question.

B0015C7N0C,,5,"As a relative newbie to Gundam models, I found this model an absolute blast to build. Like with the other kits in this series, instructions are easy to follow, and Nadleeh snaps together easily with no need for glue. Painting isn't a requirement either with the included sheet of foil stickers, though admittedly paint does enhance the finer details of the mech itself. The kit also features a number of accessories, including arm-mounted shield, GN rifle, and two beam sabers with blades (the latter of which I've noticed is lacking from certain other Gundam 00 kits).

Nadleeh proves highly poseable and quite easy to stabilize/balance no matter the position, something neither my 1/100 Kyrios or 1/144 Dynames can boast. The mech's overall design is wonderfully slim, keeping its center of balance precisely where it should be, and I was pleasantly surprised to find the feet had such a wide range of motion - one aspect I found lacking in my other models, and what helps this figure's stability. The joints move smoothly and easily, without being too loose - a trait I've observed of this line in general.

Thus far, I've only noticed two negatives of this kit. I would have enjoyed the ability to transform between Virtue and Nadleeh, but that feature might be too much for a 1/144 model. (For that, I'd have to upgrade to the 1/100 size.) Secondly, the red foil stickers for the arm shield have some difficulties adhering firmly to the plastic, so it might be a good idea to paint that section. (I've found Sharpies work wonders.)

Overall, this is a top-notch kit with more features than I expected. An excellent addition to any Celestial Being armada.","05 19, 2009",A18KQI4BJ01HGY,ashlucard713,,More than expected,1242691200,True,3,Toys_and_Games

B003F7WK30,,5,"I received this Lego set to give to my 12 year old grandson - a long time Lego enthusiast. He was absolutely thrilled when he opened the box, and immediately set to putting the kit together. With three sets of instructions, a few bouts of frustration, some help from his grandfather, and a whole lot of persistence, he finally got the kit put together. And he was so proud of his accomplishment! Personally, I think that's one of the best things about Lego kits. Like plastic model cars of old, a child has a great sense of accomplishment once these kits are put together and working. Like other kits he has completed, he enjoys playing with them ""gingerly"" so as not to pull them apart and have to start from scratch. For actual playing time, I rate the kit a 3 out of 10. But for the sense of accomplishment finishing the kit gave my grandson, as well as causing him to practice concentration, focus and following instructions, I rate it a 10 out of 10. This would make an excellent present for any Lego enthusiast in the 12 year old and up age group. And if the kit happens to get ""destroyed""?

I also have a 9 month old, so there will be plenty of use by both kids.

I really do like these blocks.  They are made of solid wood  although I do not know what kind of wood; there is nothing noted on the packaging.  They are big!  A solid 1.5 cube of wood.

The sides of the blocks that have the letters/numbers are engraved/embossed/not-a-flat-surface and are painted.  Each alphabet block has a capital letter on one side and the lower case of the same letter on the opposite side.  There are also pictures on two of the other sides that correspond with the letter on the block.  For example, the J block has a Jester and Jewels and these images appear to be burned into the wood.  There is also a number and a building element (i.e. door, window, bricks, etc) burned onto the wood on the remaining 2 sides.

Number of each letters included in the set are:
A, C, E, I, O, T  2
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  1

Included in the set are the following numbers with two numbers being on each block (a total of 5 blocks with numbers):
- 1/6
- 2/7
- 3/8
- 4/9
- 5/0

Also included are three blocks that can be used for setting up simple math equations.
- + and -
- Division sign and x
- = and ?

This set did come with a black mesh bag that has a Velcro strips at the opening to keep it closed.  The bag is a nice little bonus, but with my kids  I doubt it will hold up for long.

Although there is nothing on the packaging specifically noting that the paint is non-toxic, it does say that the product is kid safe, eco friendly, and renewable forests.

I double-checked, but it was not in the box. I figured we could still have fun with everything else in the box. Then I realized neither of the race car loops work. The launching mechanism does not connect with the latch that is supposed to hold it in place. After looking closely at the launcher, I am certain the design is faulty. So basically what I am left with is a box of junky, lightweight, very small dominoes; None of the items that are advertised as part of this set work. These dominoes are really junky. My son was so excited to set up dominos on Christmas morning, but quickly realized how shoddy this set is. I felt terrible and I felt ripped off. This is total junk.

B001HWB68K,,4,"Halo is a love or hate first person shooter series, new titles in the franchise have been spawning left and pawing into new genres. Halo has left me with mixed feelings, not being the biggest fan of the third title I still remained hopelessly interested, and thankfully ODST was right around the corner. With that said, Halo: ODST is the perfect mixture of all things good in the halo universe and more specifically the mechanics of the original title Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo: ODST has received some negative buzz due to it being an expansion that still dawns the next gen 60$ price tag. Other negativity stems from this as it is quite a short game to run through, though total completion could take a little longer.

ODST is an acronym for orbital drop shock trooper, ODST are a few steps below the beloved Spartans (think mechanized war machine), and a bit above the standard marine in the series. ODST display their colors boldly all identifiable by their unique armor. I won't sit here and explained the story to you, as the load up screen makes sure to do this for those not up to date.  The basic premise is this, scattered in the underbelly of New Mombasa you (the rookie) must search for his squad after being separated from a near cataclysmic event in the beginning.  Those who've played Halo 2 can instantly recognize what the event is, the odst on the hand weren't so lucky. You'll be fighting your way through the enemy infested city, from night city recons to bridge bombing tower scaling madness.

Game play at first would suggest a reskin of Halo 3's campaign mode, as you'll be continue to fight the aliens (known as the covenant) in a battle royal to flush them out. Don't be fooled, much of the weaponry has been altered. Better suiting an odst one will find a silenced smg, enhanced with a scope, instead of a burst firing battle rifle. Health packs have returned, you can still take cover for a quick charge for stamina, but you'll need health if you've been plucked one too many times.

 Odst also make use of the old and new. The old being the weapons we've already familiarized ourselves with in past games: assault rifle, spiker, mauler, plasma pistol, fuel rod gun/cannon, beam rifle, sniper rifle, covenant carbine, rocket launcher, and the holy grail Spartan laser so on so forth.  The new is much shorter in comparison but it will bring back many memories of the original title once more, and this would be the auto mag a pistol capable of one shot kills (if aimed at the head). Another weapon I thought I'd save to mention is the resurrection of the brute plasma rifle only seen briefly in the Halo 2 campaign. Similar to the original plasma rifle it has a maroon tone and is capable of a much higher rate of fire. Odst also like there explosives, all four grenade types from the third are available: frag, plasma, spike, and the elusive fire.

The game can start a little slow as enemies seem a tad bit more ferocious then in previous titles. After figuring out the all new visor night vision mode that outlines darkened areas and figuring out how to mark objectives on ones map the game from that point on becomes a breeze (which the above isn't very difficult). You'll be trying to reach objects that have some relativity in the disappearance of your squad. By reaching them and accessing them a cinema will approach you and you'll find yourself in a radically different situation as another member of your team as the mystery slowly reveals. Missions can grant vehicles, other odst, and/or marines.  After each mission ends you'll be taken back to the rookie and back into the descent of darkness searching for the next clue.

After the completion of the campaign if you haven't tried out cooperative campaign now's your chance. Worth of note, only two players per xbox 360 (this pertains to fire fight as well). With an internet connection and an account for xbox live (gold) you can take to the battles with up to four players. If achievements aren't your thing and don't wish to pursue the campaign after initial completion, fire fight awaits you.

Fire fight is much like Gears of War's horde mode, in which it readies you quickly for intensified battles against wave after wave of enemies coming in all shapes and sizes. To do so one must really know the in and outs of the location as well as trust their friends in time of need. After enough waves of enemies have been annihilated, things go from going too good to testing your headshots as ammo will be scarce fast. What I mean by this is simple, `skulls' serve as means to raise the difficulty bar. Each skull has a title and once turned on they come into effect, from something meager like `enemies will always try to evade your attack' to something just plain dreadful `weapons now have less ammo'. This is a great way to involve all members playing as team work goes from assisting to covering. Firefight maps are based off each campaign level; different maps have different enemy arrangements and armories to access.  Grading is done by points; every enemy taken down adds to you and your teams overall score. Stylized eliminations will grant you more points (headshots, melee, grenade sticks, multi kills etc). Use whatever means are necessary to stay alive and boost your score, as lives may be added but never are they unlimited. You and your team share lives, use them wisely. Firefight is also available to those wanting to lone wolf it, but doing so alone just doesn't encompass what the mode was made for, and is none the less more frustrating upon higher rounds.

 Special weapons like the missile pod (which I previously forgot to mention) and human/alien turret can be dismounted from there stands and used in third person they are powerful, but will slow you down a bit. Missile pods are great for locking onto enemy vehicles, the dismounted can serve as a walking confetti maker. If you don't have these kinds of weapons and see a vehicle try taking out the turrets on them, deal enough damage they'll explode, or sometimes it's just best to hide.

Odst excels in the music department, Martin o'Donnell has stepped up his game once more, Halo 3 (though again not the ultimate fan of the title) had outstanding music, o'Donnell felt it was time to use a real orchestra. With all his techniques set in place I thought I've seen the peak of his ability and the end of his ingenuity, oh how wrong I was. Opting away from the standard Halo themes we've come to know and have heard from synth to orchestration, he has readily set up a new sonic field in the Halo franchise. Bittersweet pianos, rainy jazz, hot burstbucker guitar solos, everything and more. He continues to make his ambient work flow, and his militant drum and rubbery bass as cohesive as ever. The game is musically a bit better then sat its graphics, but graphically it's pretty pleasurable. It's essentially an updated Halo 3 graphically and thankfully as it was beginning to age. What that means is you'll continue seeing Halo 3's phenomenal lighting and unique metallic finish, but at the same time a fuzz filter will be current helping to textures'.

This probably sounds so long, so thankfully the last part should be the easiest to say. Odst includes a second disc with much more value then given credit for. The second disc is Halo 3's multiplayer (aside from campaign co-op which is a given) in its entirety, this means xbox live or not you have an archive of multiplayer maps, modes, and innovative features. You can film any match you've played, take pictures of whatever you'd like, and a map editor (not a map maker) is included as well. With a connection to xbox live is near limitless for gaming opportunity. Though I much preferred the maps of Halo 2, many new maps have renewed my interest in the online. Ranks in different modes can be acquired, ranked and player matches keep track of all your stats from every kill to every medal simply by creating an account on [...]. If I sound like a rabid fanboy, I apologize, this is probably my younger cousins most played game at my house so it's only natural I know a good amount about these games by this point in time. Time for some of this dislikes I suppose.

Odst is a great game, problem is even with the value of multiplayer weighted it still isn't worth the 60$. Especially to the many who've already purchased/downloaded all the map packs, it can be a kick in the teeth. A monopoly is at foot here too, three of the maps are exclusive at the moment, without the second disc of odst some of Halo's online modes just aren't possible (thanks to the requirement of those three maps). So what it boils down to is a short but sweet campaign, that honestly isn't all too appealing to play afterwards (even with a friend a few runs go by and boredom begins to set in just looking at the screen). Firefight though fun surely can't be the only thing left can it? Well it is and shouldn't take the fall for it all, but with that remaining it's probably all you're going to be using your first disc for. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy; a romance intertwined to a war story could have worked out if emotions weren't so stale. Trailing the city as the rookie is pretty fun at first, but later on may be a breaker for those just wanting to complete the campaign. Red, red, red, tons of red, it's not that I'm unappreciative of the color, just when everything from doors to your characters HUD (head up display) glows red it is a bit of an annoyance. Especially since (as noted by many others) you'll be taking damage a lot, which is when the ugly shade makes itself most apparent. Fan of retcons? Me neither, the addition to story elements otherwise never existent in the other games makes for a sloppy translation.

B000067DPM,,4,"This game sets a new standard when it came out. With over 400 reviews to testify towards it's greatness. The game is constantly referenced when reviewing similar games in magazines and the Internet. I will only add that the game is well written and the graphics beautifully done. I can't however buy the fact it happened 4000 years before Luke and friends with relatively the same technology. Maybe 50 to 100 years by no way 4000 years. The decisions you make can change the outcome of the game and though it starts slowly on Taris by the end it's fast and addictive. Unfortunately, this isn't a perfect game. The Xbox version has slow loading times for each map. The camera angle can get stuck with you not seeing the enemy in battle. Although I choose the actions my group takes, I feel disassociated with the characters in battle. I can give moves, how to attack and preps them for battles but it's up to them to fight. I'm left on the sidelines like a coach watching the action. The battles themselves seems clumsy with swipes being made to enemies followed by long pauses and points being calculated. The main problem if it can be called that is the time it takes to complete one game. 40-50 hours depending on side quests. That's a big chunk of time for a game. It took over my life for 2 weeks. The game time was clocked at 52 hours (I fell asleep playing the game one time. Still, a game that made a mark in the video game world. The other annoying issue I had is the ""recycling of secondary character faces"". It's like a race of clones. The recycling of the Sand People came and the Eder Camp is forgivable the people that we interact really cut corners.

If you every played kid icarus uprising and had hand cramping with that game, prepare to re-live it again with this game but on both hands. This is especially true with boss battles and events where there's tons of enemies on screen and you need prefect precision to get a high scores or simply get through the level. I don't know, maybe I have giant man-hands and/or I don't want to upgrade to the 3DS XL or the more ergonomic 2DS and wanting to wait for Nintendo's next handheld that isn't a minor upgrade to the core 3DS.

Hand cramping aside, onto the review of the game.

This game is a mixture of Metriod Prime, Halo ODST and Lucio Ball
-Metriod Prime as it uses the same first person shooter exploration puzzle element.
-ODST where you're a faceless hero of the federation and have no control over the main protagonist of the series.
-Lucio Ball (From Overwatch Summer Games). In this game dubbed Blastball you use your blaster to shoot a ball to the other end like soccer/football (instead of using your feet)

The main campaign is okay. You go through mini levels lasting 10-20mins figuring out physics puzzles and clearing the stage of enemies. It's more fun with more people as enemies can be overwhelming at times. You can either play local co-op or search for random players online. For the latter, it's a mixed bag as you get people who range from have no idea what they are doing to those who played the level a dozen times and will escort you through the level. There's no voice chat and you have to select from preset gesters like in Zelda Triforce Heroes (but without the cartoony pictures).

Controls are horrible in this game. There are tilt controls in combination with the physical controls like in Splatoon, but it's implemented horribly. First off if you want to access your reticle control you have to hold onto the right trigger button. I do not understand why it isn't automatic. Guess the devs are afraid that when people are taking public transit they'll hit a speed bump or something and screw up their aim? Also the movement controls are not very fluid and feels very clunky especially in the campaign mode. The combination of the bad reticle and movement controls feels like you're controlling a tank rather than a bi-pedal space marine

Graphics. Good quality for a 3DS game. If you compare it to mobile (smart phone) or console games it's very disappointing as there are rough edges, and the backgrounds are very static. Wish Nintendo would upgrade the RAM, graphics card and launch their next handheld device. On the other hand the 3D looks very good, I tend to use it when playing the Blastball mini game or when re-visiting levels. If you play levels for the first time i recommend you turning it off as it may lower your accuracy a bit.

The story is canon to the series in case you want to experience that. There's a lot of text dialogue exposition (pages of them, most just filler and has nothing to do with the actual story) that are not voiced so it may be offputting for some, especially those who are used to playing FPS where even the instructions are voiced out to you

There is Amiibo support. I do not own the NFC amiibo adapter or a New 3DS so can't test it out. Heard you get some mods, skins and free missile ammo refills. You can quote me on that though.

Overall it's a very mixed bag. It's not as fun as the other metriod games in the series and the hand-cramping due to the controls is a bit offputting (if you own a 3ds with a c-stick or have a c-stick adapter then your experience may be better than mine).","10 3, 2016",A35042IWDE456Y,Vincent,,Metriod Prime + ODST + Lucio ball + Hand Cramp During Long Gameplay Sessions,1475452800,False,4,Video_Games
B01GWLIXY0,,4,"First up, big note here, an internet connection is required.  IF YOU MISSED THAT THE FIRST TIME -- AN INTERNET CONNECTION IS REQUIRED FOR THIS GAME.  Note, you don't have to have an Xbox Live subscription, but you do have to have an internet connection for this game.  If this is not something you want to do, then move along to another game.

With that noted, we can move into a few thoughts about this game pack.  I have to say that when I first was offered the possibility of getting this game that I was questioning whether or not there would be a requirement to have an Xbox Kinect to use with this game.  It really seems like the PERFECT type of game to use with Kinect.  You be the controller and all of that stuff that was promised with the original Kinect, and later with the Kinect for the Xbox One.  For this type of game, the idea of being able to stand on the floor bending as necessary, leaning as necessary and reenacting the motions that would be needed for the skiing and snowboarding seems like a natural occurrence to me so I was a bit surprised that this is more old school in control schemes, using the controllers and buttons on same to control the game play.  Note, that doesn't mean the game play is bad or the controls are not good, just that it seems like something that would lend itself very well to the Kinect peripheral.

The controls, while not being difficult will take some practice and getting used to.  Expect to spend a while getting yourself to a comfortable place before you'll feel better about playing this competitively.

The scenery and various game modes make this a game that I am very happy to have in my collection and would easily recommend to others.  The T for Teen rating should mean it isn't something you'd have to fear too much allowing your children to play, though as always, your mileage may vary if you connect up to Xbox Live and interact with others through that system.  (mostly be prepared for offensive language on a repeating basis)

B00104KCF8,,3,"Other than Bioshock, this is the ""strangest"" game I've played on our PS3. It just has a WEIRD feel to it.  Maybe it's the non-stop frigid planet...Or the obvious Japanese flavor to it...Or the cuss-inducing Boss battles that alternate with simple pushover Boss battles...Or the chief Japanese villain most oddly named ""Dennis Isenberg""...Or the near coma-inducing cutscenes...Or the whole Mechs vs bugs thing. Perhaps it's ALL of those together. It's just STRANGE.

However, that doesn't mean it wasn't FUN. Lost Planet has some really enjoyable aspects. The rocket-fired grappling hook allows you to move vertically in addition to the normal horizontal play of most shooters. The mechs (V-S suits) add another dimension to the battles. You also have to continually locate T-ENG to avoid freezing to death in the elements. And any game with gattling guns, rocket launchers, shotties, laser and sniper rifles, homing missles and plasma guns can't be all bad...There are even BIG versions of these weapons too that can be shot from mechs or by hand.

If you like Boss battles, then there are 3 or 4 of them in this game that will give you a pretty good challenge. They're practically impossible to win on the first try on just normal difficulty. In fact, it will take a dozen or more tries for some players. There's one (the Giant Worm) you CAN'T DEFEAT no matter what you do...You just end up throwing your PS3 out the window or giving up the game or running away (the correct option here). As a rule, I don't like games that put invincible Bosses in them. It can take a great deal of time and effort just to finally find out there was nothing you could do to win...

One of the more annoying parts of this game were the cutscenes. There are some that truly sound like the voice talent were all in the same room taking turns READING their lines with a complete absence of emotion. This makes it really hard to get into a game. In addition, your character just fought through a large portion of bug and pirate-infested frozen tundra to reach another area, then he magically appears back at the command post in an involved discussion during the next cutscene...WTH?!?! I found myself DREADING the next cutscene, repeatedly. Talk about phoned-in performances...

The controls were mostly GOOD. But I kept running into a frustrating exchange problem when trying to replace weapons on the mechs. For example, you're in the heat of battle and jump the mech over to a rocket launcher you want to place on the right side of it. If you're SLIGHTLY out of position, it shows up on the left side ready for pickup, then you get hit by Boss fire and have to maneuver back to do the same thing again, all the while taking damage. Another example is just walking up to an empty mech in a Boss battle. If you are slightly off to the side, the screen may briefly show press ""O to enter"", then you press O and end up removing the weapon off the side mount. So then you have to press ""O to attach"" it again before entering or enter first then pick up the weapon, and some of these annoying delays can make the difference in a heated Boss battle. Having another button other than just ""O"" to enter, remove and attach weapons to mechs would make more sense to me.

The end cutscene was really pretty weak. Maybe I should say EXCEPTIONALLY weak. In fact, if it's late at night, you might just fall asleep to it. And that kind of sums up my experience with Lost Planet EC. I mean, your hero character loses his memory at the exact moment he shoots the bad guy. Apparently his friends who were watching the exchange just left him there when he went face down in the snow instead of taking him inside for medical care. Then he wanders around in a roughly 1/2 mile radius outside of the main base (where his friends are inside and warm & toasty) so he can bump into them when they finally come outside several months later. Just a HORRIBLE ending that was obviously tacked on in the final moments of development. You end up saying, ""THAT WAS IT?!?!""

The whole game has the feel of a newbie director who was going for a summer blockbuster in his first directing gig, but ends up with a late night cult classic ""B"" movie instead. Some parts were enjoyable...Some parts deplorable. That's what you get with Lost Planet EC...","07 28, 2009",A9R6Z1PMRJ0BV,Twins Dad,,Fun Parts & Lame Parts...Worth a Play if Your're Bored,1248739200,False,16,Video_Games

The headband does not extend as far as the XO One and the Z11, but it does fit just barely.  It does press against the sides of my head quite snugly, however there are two mitigating factors.

1. The earcups are significantly larger.  My ears fit inside the cups so they press against my head instead of my ears.  The XO One claims to be around-ear, but for me it is more on-ear, with the ear cups pressing against the cartilage around my ears.  The Z11 is a little larger, but still presses against the peripheral of my ears.

2. The cushion on the earcups is soft.  It does a good job of distributing the force of the headphones against the sides of my head.  The earcups on the XO One are almost as soft.  The earcups on the Z11 are quite firm.

Because of the snug and form fitting fit of the XO Seven headphones, it provides very good sound isolation.  I could hear faint sounds, i.e., UI clicks, that I could not with the other headphones.

However, Silent Hill 4 is dramatically hampered by not only unbelievably terrible character movement controls (whether using a mouse/keyboard combination, or a PC gamepad), but the computer selected camera that follows the main character around makes the game truly unplayable.  The camera will many times ""decide"" to be in front of the character (pointing *towards* his face) during critical or exploratory situations, while at other times it will be hovering *over* him. Both camera angles make it almost impossible to see more than a few inches in front of your character.  This is incredibly annoying, and gets you killed a lot, and takes much of the fun out of looking around and checking things out -- because you simply can't easily do it.  (There is a key that is suppose to force the camera back behind the character, but it rarely works as it should).

B00M3D8IYM,,5,"When I took a new job back in mid-1994, the IT guy finished setting up my computer and as he left he said ""Have you played Doom?"" ""No."" ""You will."" The head of IT was a Doom fanatic and was happy to install it on anyone's PC for the asking. MP was played on the LAN on most evenings. Sometimes we'd come in on the weekends to work, sometimes just to play Doom. When we weren't playing MP, I'd play the single player game. A few months after I started, Doom 2 arrived and we upgraded to that. It was basically more of the same, but that certainly wasn't a bad thing. 10 years later Doom 3 came out, and by that time the LAN games had long since ended at work, but of course by then I had a PC at home. I loved Doom 3, but it was very different from the first two games. Less of a frenetic lightning fast run & gun and more of a moody deliberately paced survival horror type of game.

Doom 4 (this game was originally announced as such and I continue to refer to it for clarity) is something of a cross between Dooms 1 & 2,  and Doom 3. The visual design and ""world building"" more or less picks up where Doom 3 left off, but game play wise it's very much a return to form. The first half of the game is already much more intense and chaotic than Doom 3, but the second half is just freaking insane. There's a little advice blurb that pops up on load screens that basically says ""Keep moving. Always. If you stop moving, you die."" and it's absolutely true. In the later levels I couldn't believe how many enemies the game was throwing at me, and I'm not talking just possessed humans and Imps. I'm talking multiple Cacodaemons, Mancubi, Hell Knights, etc. all coming after me at the same time. The quantity and speed is especially impressive in light of how much eye candy is on display. Maybe it's my age showing, but I found the default difficulty level ""Hurt Me Plenty"" to be quite challenging. I died a lot. But I loved every second of it. The game play is decidedly old school, but the weapon mods and latent abilities via armor upgrades and hell runes add a healthy layer of modernity. I didn't keep track of how many hours it took to complete the SP campaign, but it must have been at least 15. I started Friday evening and didn't stop til bedtime, played all day Saturday, and the last push was Sunday morning to about 2PM, made me late for lunch. For my money this is far, far superior to Wolfenstein TNO.

I lost my taste for MP many years ago, that aspect of the game doesn't factor into my review.

B002BSC54I,,3,"Update - My first review was written based upon the opening sequence and part of the first dungeon, and I thought I just needed to get used to the controls.  It is now clear that the controls do not work as intended. I have revised my rating to 3 stars due to the fact that the controls don't work properly when you are actually fighting against an enemy.

After playing several more hours this game also feels extremely redundant, sluggish, and full of annoying fetch quests.  Definitely not the best Zelda game and I would expect much more from any game in 2013, especially after spending $40 for a wii-mote ""plus"" that behaves just as poorly as the regular wii-mote.  FAIL. Also, the stamina bar gets old fast.  I feel like they only put the stamina meter in the game to try and copy better, more popular games that have a focus on realism, but the stamina bar has no place in a cartoonish game like Zelda where there isn't a trace of realism in any other sense, and why should there be?  The more I look at it the more idiotic it seems. Also, Fi sux. F Fi.

_____________________________________________________________________
Wow. I was the most skeptical person about this game and it's supposed life-like controls but I will say I was wrong and I am truly blown away so far by Skyward Sword.  I am a fan of the Zelda franchise, and have completed all of their most mainstream titles. (at age 5 I even watched my older sister beat the infamous Zelda II). I would definitely say that just the first 2 hours of Skyward Sword are a masterpiece and have already been well worth the purchase price.

  The controls are everything.  Link's sword follows your wiimote near flawlessly, making this the most realistic game ever made control-wise.  It also makes it quite challenging, and requires new strategies aside from button-mashing.  It is challenging in a good way though; fun and not tedious (so far).  I am still very early in the game but can already tell this will be possibly the best zelda game yet. I am as enthralled as the day I first popped in Skyrim.

  The only downsides I have encountered so far are the textures and the often slow-moving text dialogue.  Still no english voiceovers, which is fine, but I often find myself stuck in the same conversation box multiple times with no quick way out, which can get annoying.

  Also, one of my first reactions to this game was ""what's up w/ the s***** graphics?"" but as soon as you get into the story that doesn't matter anymore.  The polygon textures are often downright attrocious, but the artwork/style is beautiful and astounding. You will soon get lost in the world of Skyward Sword and overlook its texture flaws.

  The music is simply breathtaking... in a good way not the seinfeld way. The separate music cd is masterfully composed as well, and sweetens the deal.  I really just don't see any downside to purchasing this game.  It is a must play title and a great reason to dust off your wii.","03 21, 2013",AMPSU4YEO7L5G,razrodude,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},Just got my a__ handed to me by a plant...,1363824000,False,,Video_Games

B000HEB3UU,,5,"Kirby Squeak Squad DS lets you take the deliciously fun shape-shifting pink guy on a platforming trek, storing and mixing up skill sets.

I adore Kirby games, and Squeak Squad DS is no exception. You're jumping down holes, climbing up ladders, and navigating mazes of course. But the main task of Kirby-land is to figure out what items are available to eat - and then to combine together multiple items to come up with cool new techniques.

The activation sequence is a bit tricky - you have to spin your finger around the four directions of the D pad to turn things on - but it's well worth it. The cool combinations you can come up with are great fun!

You're allowed to store items in ""bubbles"" in Kirby's stomach, which is what the bottom half of your DS screen is dedicated to. This lets you choose what item to use in a certain situation, or to combine them together if you wish.

Even more fun, as you go you unlock color options for Kirby himself. Interested in a blue kirby, or a citrus-colored Kirby? You can do it! Of course, many traditionalists will insist that Kirby only comes in one color, that is Pepto-Bismol Pink.

The game is well done, in that it's both simple enough for younger players and entertaining enough for older players as well. It's relatively short, so that you can use it to pass the time while waiting in line at the supermarket or taking a bus ride without worrying about memorizing arcane combinations of keys or memorizing a rule book of negotiation tactics.  You have just as much fun replaying it, aiming to unlock every chest you find and to get through as quickly as possible.

I admit that I still adore the days of The Crystal Shards and hope that these styles of games will come out on the Wii in the future. But for travel playing, Kirby Squeak Squad definitely fits the bill as fun, easy to learn, engaging and short enough to fit in the spaces you have available in your schedule.

Well recommended!","06 9, 2007",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,Lisa Shea,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},Great Fun for Kirby Fans,1181347200,False,32,Video_Games

Newer gamers will recognize him from his Wii debut in Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Most everyone I know immediately recognizes Nintendo's mascot. He's a very familiar character!

His debut on the Nintendo DS brought a tear of joy to my eye. Not only does he do his familiar platforming, he was upgraded with better graphics, many new moves from his previous games, and great music and sound effects rounded out this delightful title. Needless to say, I was hooked. For anyone that likes (or loves) Mario from any age group or era, you won't be disappointed with this title for your DS. It's one of those ""must have"" games you absolutely NEED in your DS library.

Pros:

It's Mario, with his fabulous moves and attitude
Great graphics abound
Sound and music are top-notch and toe-tapping
Run, jump, score with Mario once again!

Cons:

Seems a little difficult, perhaps too much so, in certain areas
Frustration can make you pull your hair out and put the game away

Overall, this is a great game to have, to play, and to keep near and dear to your heart. Mario has been a favorite for many years, and he just keeps getting better and better. One additional thing I love about this game is that it's easy to gain extra lives. That was a smart move on Nintendo's part to keep you playing.

B000R0PLK2,,5,"The Orange Box is a fantastic product (or set of products) that really redefine FPS gaming altogether.  I did not remember much about Half Life 1, but its OK, the story will fill you in and make it seem like a brand new experience.  My play through of Half Life 2 lasted for over 10 hours (!), and including Episodes 1 and 2, my total play time was somewhere around 15-18 hours, which is a pretty amazing value for an FPS.  If you played HL2 on the PC as I did, don't be dissuaded into not getting the Orange Box.  The value isn't bad either, considering that you would need to shell out quite a few more dollars to purchase each game separately (and also have 5 separate disks).  Portal wasn't my cup of tea, but it does change your mind's problem solving process.  It was a very innovative idea and pretty neat experience.

Team Fortress 2 would be the only overall negative of the Orange Box.  I am not sure what kind of traffic the game receives on the PC, but there are very few people playing on XBL at any given time, and lag is commonly an issue.  Plus, I think many people assume that it will be similar to Counter Strike, and that is definitely NOT the case.

B00ZQB28XK,,1,"The only reason for playing this game would be that you pre-ordered it after falling for the hype, as I did.

Great games have stunning compelling graphics created by an army of graphics artists. Instead, Hello Games is still talking about its algorithms.

The game is devoid of warmth or humanity. Your character has no body, personality or customizable attributes. It is a space suit; in the end just like every other players spacesuit. There are a couple of cartoon alien character models whose voices are a few screeches. You don't learn their languages; their statements finally appear in English after youve clicked 400+ buttons scattered about the landscape.

The space ships look like they're from a toddlers coloring book. The space ship control panels still look like sketches on a napkin. The pacing of action is incredibly sparse and jerky. You teleport by listening to a vacuum cleaner sound for 20 seconds while a yellow blob pulses on screen.

Nothing has a purpose. The game is endless monotony. The Foundation update added more fetch quests to keep you busy; very busy because finding what you need to fetch is random and requires lots of slow monotonous travel. The PathFinder update just adds more of the same. The updates jut give the game more opportunities to tell you to do more things to try to keep you busy so you don't notice they have nothing to do with moving towards completion of the game. They remove some tedium of surface travel, at the expense of requiring a lot more of it.

1. No online co op. Frankly this was my favorite part of R2 so I have no freaking clue why they didn't include it.

2. The story is non existent. There is absolutely nothing new learned about the chimera or what they are doing here. Also the main character's personality and looks are completely 100% changed from R2. Why bother having the character named Joseph Capelli if you change *everything* about him?!?

3. The campaign is much shorter than the previous 2 games.

4. The boss battles are extremely lacking compared to R2. There are also significantly fewer boss battles, and most of the boss creatures are reused repeatedly throughout the game making their wonder fall significantly.

5. The credits imply that after the end of the game that the chimera are defeated, yet the final cutscene gives absolutely no explanation as to how or why that is happening. All you manage to do is destroy one single building in New York, yet somehow the chimera are defeated across the planet?!? Makes no sense at all. The scale of the story is cut back significantly.

6. The online competitive is the same mediocreness as the previous games. If you like online pvp you are better off playing Call of Duty.

The good parts:

1. Combat is amazing as we have come to expect. If you liked R2 combat you will love the gameplay of this one.

2. The weapon wheel is back and is as fun as ever.

3. The areas that you travel through are amazing and creepy and a joy to turn every corner.

You also do exercises on days that you aren't doing a training exercise or you can do a challenge.  Theres just too many glitches in this game though.

I was originally only training with Jillian, and then today I decided Bob and Jillian. Why for the full 40 minutes did I only train with Bob?  The WII balance board...why I really like using it, it gets to be a real pain in the neck.  Move your balance board out of the way...move your balance board into position.  Sometimes the game even tells me to move my balance board out of the way, put the WII remote into my right hand.....and then it tells me to move my balance board into position!  Then it tells you to put the WII remote into your pocket which I don't have I have to like stick it down my shorts(disgusting I know but what am I supposed to do)?  The remote doesnt pick up all the moves so Bob and Jillian are yelling at you even though you are doing the exercises.

I am not training with Jillian anymore because I don't see the point. You are training with Jillian and yet Bob is doing the voice overs telling you how to do the exercises.

Today Bob was telling me to put the WII remote into my right hand while the exercise was already starting.  I get up to all 5 bars and then Bob tells me that I didn't do so well.

B00002STPE,,5,"Any true fan of the Legacy of Kain/ Soul Reaver series must place this game at the top of their list in the series, as not only did this entry set the tone and the pace for the rest of the series, but it was a turning point for well done voice acting incorporated with a twisting and turning plot, which leaves you guessing until the very end. First things first though, this game has some of if not the worst loading times of all time in my honest opinion. However, if you can imagine the top down perspective of Legend of Zelda: A link to the Past with the graphics that were full of drab dark colors, creating an almost gothic overtone, you might realize why this game was pushing the Playstation 1 to its proverbial limits. The music is equally as enthraling, with a mixture of orchestral quality dynamics, and haunting sounds that will stay with you long after the game is turned off.

Overall the game is one of the best role plaing/action games on the system, and combined with one of the most engaging storylines ever devised, as well as some of the most gut wrenching and blood filled cinemas , the game pushed the limits of what could be allowed on Playstation (look at the censoring of the original Resident Evil for example). But it is not just this eclectic mixture that gives this game top honors in my book; it is more so in its ability to draw the player into Kains soul, witnessing his will being torn apart at the seams as he attempts to confront his own personal demons, upon being turned into a vampire at the beginning of the game. Upon awakening in his sanctuary, Kain finds the world much more to his liking, although the further he continues into his quest the more he questions his original willingness to become a vampire. Epic in every sense of the word, I dar anyone who says they are a videogame junkie to complet this game 100%, as this is a true test of patience, as well as utter skill. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked, once you realize just how engaging this game truly is, with completly different weapons at your disposal (you just can't forget the hum of the Soul Reaver the first time you acquire it) to the numerous types of armor, and magic you acquire, this game is an overlooked gem.

B00IKQDULC,,4,"The negative review from Game Informer almost kept me from buying this game, but I'm glad that I did.  I'll go over each of the core aspects of the game and give you what I liked and what I didn't.

==============================

Combat (4/5)

Has a very God of War like feel to it.  In fact, much of the game does.  If you feel that a God of War style presentation or combat system strays too far from Castlevania's roots then you may not like it, but if you enjoyed the combat in God of War you'll like it here as well.

You have 3 main melee weapons.  The Shadow Whip is the weapon you'll use most often and it has the best range.  The Void Sword has a shorter range but replenishes health when you strike enemies with it.  The Chaos Claws deal the most damage but have short range, and are the only weapons that can deal damage to some shielded foes.

Each weapon has it's own skill tree.  There are skill trees that you can progress in as you gain experience points.  You can also ""master"" certain skills by using them more.  Once mastered, they become more effective in combat.  This encourages you to use combos and skills that you may not have otherwise used as often, so that you can master them as well.

You also have access to projectiles like daggers, which do different things depending on which melee weapon you have equipped, you can send a swarm of bats to distract enemies for the stealth sections, and several relics exist that can be used as limited items such as the classic hourglass that slows enemies' movement, a bird that can reveal secret locations, a health replenishing flask, and others.

The camera can be a bit of an annoyance at times as it tends to leave some enemies off-screen and you may not realize that they're about to attack, which leaves you vulnerable.

My only other complaint is that it's sometimes difficult to perform a lengthy combo as most enemies don't get ""stun locked"" by your attacks and can then break your combo by hitting you, even while you're hitting them.

===============================

Story (4/5)

The game is almost too story heavy at first, forcing you to sit through quite a few narrated scenes.  They're important, however, as the Belmont lineage and their place in the story needs to be examined.  An artful presentation at least makes these scenes interesting to look at while they fill you in on back story.

Ultimately the story is pretty interesting especially if you've followed along with Lords of Shadow and the Mirror of Fate.

===================================

Graphics (3/5)

Not a bad looking game, but not top of the line either.  Some of the meshes have some pretty jagged edges, particularly when at a distance, even with settings maxed.  Some of the shadows/light during cut scenes can appear unrealistic and distracting when the jagged edged shadows tend to spill over the curvature of the characters' faces, etc.  This is not uncommon in gaming at the moment however.

This game is heavy on blood (as can be expected), but in some moments when blood is shooting up or exploding out, it doesn't look very fluid.  Again, not an easy thing to model and animate, but still needs to be pointed out.

===========================

Other gameplay (3/5)

Much criticism has been leveled at the game's stealth sections, although I didn't find them to be overly unpleasant.  Changing into rat form to explore air vents or tunnels is actually fairly fun.  My biggest complaint about the stealth sections is that you're not allowed to engage in combat, which is where the game shines.  It almost seems arbitrarily thrown in, as if the developers wanted another aspect to the gameplay besides combat and exploration.

Much worse than the stealth sections are the platforming sections.  Swinging on chandeliers is a series staple, but in this game it feels clunky and bothersome.  Climbing feels fairly natural though and can be compared to games like Uncharted or God of War.

The game does allow for that Metroidvania style exploration however.  Although most of the environments are not truly open world, they are large enough to allow for exploration and finding secrets.  Many of the secret areas cannot be accessed until you have the appropriate skill or item, much like other Castlevania games, Metroid games or Zelda games.

==================================

Art/Presentation (4/5)

I applaud the designers for thinking outside the box and bringing the series into the modern era, but that's my biggest complaint about the setting.  Although much of the game is in modern times, you'll still find yourself in gothic environments with old dilapidated castles, cathedrals and buildings, which keeps it from being too futuristic.  I think we can all agree that Dracula fighting enemies in Times Square would be a huge mistake, and the developers avoided that pitfall.  Still, seeing an electronic billboard or steel doors that can only be opened by a retina scanner just don't feel like they belong.

Make no mistake though, there is plenty of dark imagery, horrific and grotesque monsters, and dim hallways with flickering candlelight.

=========================

The soundtrack is fantastic.  The sound effects feel right at home.  If I had one complaint it's that some of the characters' voice actors aren't quite up to par, but most of the major characters do a good job, especially Patrick Stewart who voices Zobek.

============================

In conclusion, this is a very enjoyable game that brings the Lords of Shadow series to a close in style.  The stealth and platforming sections keep it from being a true masterpiece, but they're not so frequent as to ruin the rest of the great things this game has to offer.  Buy with confidence and enjoy!","02 25, 2014",AJ2OU10N9SXF8,Theology and video games ,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},Fun game that does the series proud,1393286400,False,49,Video_Games
B000JLMZS0,,5,"I have played a dozen of MMO beginning with UOL and finishing with Age of Conan that I have just desinstalled fatre it occupied my HD for full whooping 8 days .
In my personnal ranking sofar I had :
EQ N1 for immersion and the size of the world
LOTRO N1 for graphics and a consistent story line/quest system
EQ2 N1 for trade skills

After a friend's suggestion I had installed Vanguard 1 week ago .
Sofar it has been a very rewarding experience .

The overall feeling is clearly EQ like while many additionnal features were added .
The strong points I already noticed :
- a mature player basis . Many quilds require 18+ for membership and the players are accordingly rather helpfull and patient . That makes for a pleasant change after having suffered for 1 + year the WoW masses .
- a very good customer service . Friday evening I have made a /report about a quest that wouldn't update correctly . I expected that I would perhaps get a mail on Monday telling me that they were working on it . Instead after 10 minutes I got a tell from a GM who joined me immediately and solved the problem . He was very friendly and polite what also was a pleasant change after most of other MMOs .
- original and excellent diplomacy system . Especially the newbie diplomacy quests are interesting and make for a good introduction in the game (as a Gnome I have been incorporated in the counterintelligence department and charged with the investigation of strange disappearance of mages and inventors) .
- the trade skills are similar to EQ2 that I rank N1 so , obviously , I am very satisfied with it
- the world is huge and non instanced what enhances the immersion feeling
- the classes are very complementary and balanced . On top of the classical EQ classes (with enchanters called psionists here) there are blood mages and disciples . Sofar I have tried only 3 (necromancer , bard and psionist) and they get all 3 a very different gaming feel .
- patience is needed and players don't get spoonfed with items , XP and gold by just running around 10 minutes . That has also the merit that it effectively eliminates most kids that want everything at once . The death penalty is a good thing in that respect too .

To the weaker points I'd mention :

- one doesn't see many players . My highest level is 12 and I have met players only in the big cities . Sofar it was easy to solo but I play MMORPGs mostly for the first MM . If I wanted to go solo , I would not buy an OL game . I also noticed that calls for groups were extremely rare and when it happened it was in the 30ies range . I have been told that :
a) the world is so huge that players are all over the place
b) the bad launch of the game has chased most of the players away but the population began to go again up since SOE took over , eliminated most of the bugs and implemented features that were not there at launch
c) a free trial is foreseen in september that would create an influx of new players
Well wait and see . It was precisely the huge player basis that had been an important element of the immersion feeling in EQ .

- the graphics and character customisation . While not bad it could be improved

- too fast day/night change . It is irritating . I'd scale it to something like 3 hours day and 1 hour night .

Definitely the strong and original points of this game largely outweigh the weaker points and there is still potential to improvement by future releases .
I'd even rank it overall a tad above LOTRO that was for me sofar the best ""modern"" MMORPG .

I recommend it to any mature player and certainly to all those who appreciated EQ .","09 4, 2008",A3RO5NF0U4QJ38,Thomas,{'Platform:': ' PC'},Refreshing,1220486400,False,5,Video_Games
B0009R1SZA,,4,"If you compare the cost of buying this movie from a Used reseller vs the cost of a bad summer action flick then this game is a bargain. I actually enjoyed this game. Nothing deep to figure out, just pick up the controller and mash buttons with a friend.

Pros:

- Simpler game interface and customizations than previous generation of Gauntlet. I actually prefer this simplification. I found Gauntlet Dark Legacy a bit excessive in the customization department and found myself ignoring most of it.

- Returns Gauntlet to its simpler origins.

- Graphics are quite good, there are some landscape scenes that are really quite well done.

- Musical score is decent, and sets the mood appropriately.

- Shorter game. I think this is a Pro rather than a Con - I found  the previous generation a bit too long for my taste, and frankly got tired of it so never finished it.

Cons:

- Game is repetitive- but frankly Gauntlet has always been repetitive.","08 9, 2006",A7GXT5V1VL5UT,J. Leigh,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},Good mindless eye candy- don't expect more and you'll enjoy it,1155081600,False,4,Video_Games
B000B6MLUA,,5,"... you need to add these to your system.

Not much to say other than Wireless on the 360 is done most excellently.  These controllers are great.

I use rechargeable AA batteries in place of the disposable ones and in place of the rechargeable battery pack.  I have played with the disposable batteries and notice nothing different in the way of controller performance.  Try out the rechargeable AA batteries and a fast charger.  I think you'll find that you have more flexibility for the money.  My experience on the charge retention has been good.  I play a great deal of games with a lot of vibration feedback.  My batteries last for a good long time.

If you go the way of rechargeable batteries, make sure you get AA batteries with a high milliamp rating.  Consider the controllers to be as power hungry as a digital camera (although they aren't) and you'll be good to go.","04 11, 2007",ABAW1TNE54PJ8,David G.

B00006IIVJ,,4,"After being a very avid fan of Combat Flight Simulator 2 for almost six months, my computer crashed and many of the CFS2 files were lost, and missing disc 1, I couldn't reinstall the game. Figuring I was getting bored of it anyway I began considering the purchase for the third installment in the CFS franchise. When I first got this game, I was blown away in the first thirty seconds by the graphics of the game, then thirty-one seconds in the program crashed due to overheating. If you want this game, and you have a laptop, consider getting a cooling pad our you will put yourself through a lot of grief with this problem. The campaign mode in this game can be very confusing, it is a living map and the actions that you perform affect the games outcome.

The game puts you in the cockpit of a fighter pilot from USA, Britain, or Germany, as well as having the option of being a bomber pilot (you can switch as a gunner, pilot, or bombardier in any mission)from any of the three countries. To win the campaign you kind of have to understand what happened in world war II, as the whole concept is that you can change the outcome of the war. Aside from the campaign, there is a mission builder that you can obtain from the website (just google it!) so if the game isn't enough for you, you can design your own missions and completely run away from any historical accuracy to make absurdly intense missions (which I highly reccomend.) Because as a fighter you are doing primarily ground attack missions, the game doesn't come as much of a challenge, so changing the realism options (how much your plane really behaves like a real plane such as G-effects, stall speeds ect.) makes the game quite challenging. If you find that you ran out of stuff to do, don't forget there is always quick combat and historical and What-If (mainly early Jet Fighter dogfights) to keep you entertained. Make sure you always challenge yourself with new missions because doing the same mission over and over can get pretty dull.

In conclusion

 This game is really a unique experience, as the game its self puts you in a world of endless aerial scenarios that will rock your socks day in and day out! If you are a huge fan, consult some CFS3  forums, where Add-ons that can really enhance your gaming experience!","08 9, 2009",A1FO62XDSFFZ6V,Daniel Davis,,Combat flight simulator 3-The almost perfect game,1249776000,False,,Video_Games
B000NVKZ06,,5,"I've always wanted to try out the Harvest Moon games. They were my ex-girlfriend's favorite game, and my brother spent alot of time playing ""Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life"" on the PS2, but I never picked it up... Namely because eventhough I loved Animal Crossing (A similar game on the GameCube) after you finished building your house and decorating it, the rest of the game becomes tedious with nothing to do but waiting for the next season and more bugs/fish to catch... *YAWN*
Anyway, I feared that Harvest Moon would be the same thing on a larger scale, so I never actually got around to playing it. But then one day, I saw an ad in ""Electronics Gaming Monthly"" for ""Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon"" Being a HUGE fan of RPGs like The Legend of Zelda & Final Fantasy, I knew that if there was any Harvest Moon that was practically made for me, this was it!

After playing it, I absolutely love it! And not for the fighting, monster taming, 3D graphics, and RPG formula that I thought I would, but for the farming aspect of past Harvest Moon games! This is nothing like the boring and tedious work in Animal Crossing, it's truely fun and immersive. Plowing the field, planting the crops & watering them every morning, then selling them and saving up enough money to improve your home and gain the affection of one of 10 lovely ladies!
All the girls are pretty cool, but which one you choose really depends on your personality. (Personally, I like Melody & Mei, having either a Witch or a Ninja for a wife sounds cool! lol)
Plus, having 10 girls to choose from compared to the old standard 3 girls in past Harvest moon games will be a breath of fresh air to long-time fans of the series.

The funnest part of the game is that there is so much to do! You'll find yourself running all about town to talk to the ladies you like, to the dock to go fishing, watering & harvesting your crops, putting all the fruits of your hard work into the collection bin, making a run through the caves to increase your level by fighting monsters, and before you know it, the day is done and you gotta go to bed! (Both in the game and in real life)

I could go on and on about this game, but I know alot of people don't like to read long reviews, so I'll leave anything I may have missed to the other reviewers...

All I can say is, this game is packed with more stuff to do than anyone could ever hope to put in a short review!
This game is pure excellence, and I highly recommend picking up a copy for yourself.

B0166QDJZE,,5,"Before i review this awesome game I'd just like to ask a simple question
When did consumers become so stupid?
A new thing in the 8th generation of console gaming has been
Paying hard earned money for a preview/beta of a game (That isn't even guaranteed to be the final version or even released for that matter)
People are paying a premium to test out a beta
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
Ark Survival Evolved is one of these Preview titles that looks like a Dreamcast game and the gaming community being the suckers they are
Pay for a unfinished game then go nuts for it like it's the best thing since slice bread

If you loved Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon but, Far Cry 4 was somewhat of a let down
This is the game for you
Far Cry Primal is hands down the best 8th Generation game put out by UbiSoft to date

Story: The story itself is very basic to some extent
Your a caveman during the stone age your goal is to survive and build a community

Controls: If you played previous FC games you'll get the hang of it pretty quick
the combat is primitive but, it also adds more layers how to play using fire is a huge tool
The only major negative with the controls are when you try and use the eagle to scout ahead of you
Then things feel ""off""

Audio very impressive the music score is HQ
you also have a lost language so there is no English being spoken
But, there's subtitles
Each animal you encounter has there own sound very organic

Graphics also very impressive
the caveman look strange at first but, It's  10,000 BC
They shouldn't look like modern humans
The environment also looks awesome from the rain effects, water even the day/night cycle
All the animals also look very real/life like most of the time
Once you tame a animal and they join you
At any point when the animal is with you you can heal them (with meat) or pet them
There is a strange graphic animation when you try and pet most of the animals you tame
When you pet them then the animal looks more cartoony... It's a little jarring at first
besides that almost every animal looks amazing the way they move and act is close to spot on

Gameplay: If you played any of the previous Far Cry games
Primal is just that but, it's turned on it's ear being set so far back
The challenge is very balanced but, you'll die a lot
Some of the animals you first encounter are relentless
The various animals are the biggest threats
The open world itself is massive in scale the biggest problem with such a huge map is  getting from point A to point B
Once you start taking over areas you can fast travel but, there's a lot of ground to cover
The environments go from green forests to snow covered mountains
Hunting is once again a major gimmick in the Far Cry series
Everything you hunt has a purpose
Don't get-off on killing animals even in video games
But, you kind of have to if you want to level up and conquer the land

This is one of the best experience I've had with a FPS since the Bioshock games/Far Cry 3
If you want a solid unique FPS that's really like nothing out there at least rent this to see if it's your type of game
It's ambitious and very different  9.5/10

B003PHLT8W,,4,"There are some kinds of games you play where you're just in it to plain have fun. Having a nice story or decent dialogue would be a plus but in the end, you're really just playing so you can shoot up baddies in the coolest ways. Vanquish is a game that accomplishes this with stylized combat and very little plot substance.

The title follows DARPA agent Sam Gideon encased in a super-fast, sleek Augmented Reaction Suit as he fights off Russians in space to stop them from attacking New York with a giant super weapon. The combat is mainly a third-person shooter with several different melee elements that make Vanquish unique.

Pros:
1) The combat system sticks to tried and true formulas for third-person shooting (i.e. weapons changing, targeting, etc.) but the aspect of the ARS suit allowing Sam to boost past enemies, enable a slow down of time, or melee with ridiculous power makes the game fun. After getting a good grip on the controls, you'll soon find yourself sliding across a room, shooting a couple of enemies on your way, and finishing with a wild drop kick in the face of a giant robot enemy. The combat reeks of style and keeps the experience fresh.

2) The game is actually challenging from the get go. Even on normal mode players will find themselves getting swarmed by enemy AI or diving for cover from the next wave of baddies. The enemy characters also fit the difficulty in that some move very fast or are more armored and force the player to adjust their combat strategy accordingly. This makes overcoming all the boss fights and waves that much more satisfying.

3) The graphics are very pretty if not a little repetitive. The game takes place on a shiny metallic space colony so everything has the look and feel of new-age machinery. There are a few breaks from this where the environments change to small forests and service tunnels (which give way to another stylistically amazing combat break) but overall everything is very pretty and of high quality.

Cons:
1) The plot is disappointing in that it starts off with promise but pretty much abandons itself in favor of the stylized combat. Many of the side characters like Burns or Zaitsev prove to be nothing more than arbitrary ways of putting Sam in another tedious (albeit cool looking) fight. A better plot would have given the action better pace and not make it feel like it dragged on.

2) The campaign is only about 4-5 hours long. Because of the lack of plot I feel like this amount of time is appropriate (certain missions do drag on for awhile) but compared to other third-person shooters, Vanquish is on the short side.

3) Replay value is a bit low. The game does sport unlockable trophies/achievements, a few collectibles, and a challenge mode where you must fight your way through waves of enemies, but other than replaying the campaign on harder difficulties there's not much to Vanquish after the first playthrough.

Overall Vanquish is a beautifully entertaining action shooter. It may be a bit light on plot and character depth but it never takes itself too seriously to get in the way of the fun. Buy it if you're into hack n'slash or third-person shooter games, rent it if you tend to like longevity to your gaming experiences.","02 20, 2011",AKJYRLAMBSSFP,hakuryu12,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},Style Over Substance,1298160000,False,3,Video_Games

B0037LTTRO,,4,"Overview:
This 3rd person action shooter is very involving. A good story that keeps you going and flows through to the end. The campaign is not too short and changes it up as you go along, and you can co-op through the entire thing. The MP is very detailed with a number of different maps to start with in addition to guerilla mode which is a little twist on the normal.

Single Player:
Playing through the campaign to me was a lot of fun. I would try different tactics and ways of attacking an objective to see if I could eliminate the opposition as quickly and efficiently as possible. Most missions you can choose your route and execute your plans however you would like. If you don't want to use stealth you don't have to in most situations, although there are a couple of sequences where you cannot have any alarms (so you can either take them out silently/coordinated attacks or you can avoid them all together). Even though you have ""active camo"" if you are moving within their vision or too noisy they will see/hear you.
The game looks really good, great maps and environments. I especially enjoyed the things that would break from the norm, using the UCV (unmanned combat vehicle, basically a mobile mortar platform), the gunship sequences, and getting to play with all the fun gadgets and unlockable attachments. There are weapon challenges, tactical challenges, etc. for each mission that are diffcult to achieve. Unfortunately there is NO match-making system for the co-op campaign. Also, when you start a mission, if a buddy comes online after there is no ""drop-in"" option.

MP:
Each team is made up of two 4-man squads. You can spawn on your squad or at your spawn point. There are 3-classes to choose from that have their own advantages. Scout- sniper, has coaking ability. Engineer- intel expert, can spot enemies with sensor grenades, UAV, etc. Rifleman- explosives, extra armor class. There are several different game modes: Siege (no respawn), Sabotage (plant the bomb), Conflict (changing objectives that are worth points), and Decoy (hack the bases to find the real base and attack it). The single-player also unlocks addition weapons for MP.

Guerrilla Mode / Co-op Survival:
The twist on your survival mode. You have to infiltrate an area, neutralize the threats and then hold your ground until you can advance to the next area. As you make it through the waves, support options are made available. Gun turrets, air strikes, etc. Very fun for 4-players. Unfortunately, again, there is no match-making for Co-op.

Gunsmith:
In singleplayer/MP gives you the option of changing up your attachments, paint, and internals of each weapon you bring to the fight. In singleplayer most of the options are already unlocked, but some you have to gain by finishing tactical objectives on certain missions. For MP, some unlocks come from the campaign, while most are from ranking up and gaining tokens to unlock certain attachments. Each class also has ""decision points"" which are free unlocks, but you can only pick one from two options. For example: Engineer's first is between the UAV and the hacking tool. Sniper's first is between a custom sniper scope and a thermal scope. Rifleman's first is between the smoke GL and an underbarrel stun round. If you go to Uplay, there's an unlockable that gives you BOTH at one decision point of your choosing.

Outside Interaction:
--There was a 'prequel' that came out, you can view it on youtube (GHOST RECON: ALPHA)
--Download the mobile App, it allows for you to modify your weapons in the gunsmith on the fly. Also gives you 6 free unlocks for MP. I tried it out for Android and works really well. You can use it in ""Free Mode"" or ""Sync Mode"" which allows for your customizations to be uploaded to your game next time you play.
--Try out the FaceBook App, it gives a couple of unlocks and some gun skins.
--The Ghost Recon Network site also gives you some unlocks for the game if you have played previous TomClancy titles, enter certain code words, played the FB app, etc.

Summary:
A lot of options here for replayability and for the completionist. I'm definitely going to go through the missions again and try to knock out the weapon and tactical objectives that I missed. That and will have to play through with some friends to try the co-op aspects. In addition to gaining ranks in the MP so I can unlock some more crazy weapons and abilities.","05 30, 2012",AO5B7TLBAHMK6,B.

B00B67ZTUW,,5,"UPDATE: Not much of a review just more of a what I thought. Now I have since played Tales of Xillia 2, Tales of Vesperia, Tales of Symphonia, and Tales of Zestiria.. I would say this. Tales of Vesperia is by far my absolute FAVORITE, but this once is clearly 2nd.

Tales of Xillia

PROS:

Story: I thought it was a good story, sure not as great Vesperia, but I felt like it made sense to me. no. I don't really nitpick I just want something that makes me feel like finishing the story.

Characters: Ok, I really like Jude, and I think Milla is not the best female character but shes pretty good. Again, you are not going to beat Yuri and Estelle but I think this combo works. As for the support, theres no one I really dislike. I actually didn't care too much for Symphonia characters

Graphics: I still think the graphics are good.. but a bit more depressing in general than Vesperia. Vesperia has the most enticing locations and graphics. Xillia falls a little behind... Zesteria, maybe.

Gameplay: not much to say about gameplay but I will say I liked it over Tales of Zestiria. Just again... not as good as... you guessed it.. Vesperia.

Cons:

I don't want to make a list of formal cons just a short rant. Overall the game felt like a step down in everything from Tales of Vesperia. I just felt like I didn't think the story was as good, the characters as good or the graphics as good. The gameplay I actually liked more than Zestiria and I couldn't even figure out the fighting for Xillia 2.

Overall it's a great game. You really should try it. Unless of course you have not gotten Tales of Vesperia. ARE YOU CRAZY?!","01 3, 2015",A21HP1LOJF30E7,VenturePopTV,{'Color:': ' Playstation 3'},2nd right behind Tales of Vesperia,1420243200,True,,Video_Games

This game, however, is basically a Gears of War/Halo clone. The innovative weaponry is mostly gone. The ability to carry multiple weapons is mostly (you can still carry two) gone.

We didn't personally have any problems getting the remote to pair and then work with the PS4. Haven't yet played all of our apps, so there may be problems down the road, but, for right now, we are happy with the PS4 functionality. The ""universal"" remote for other devices definitely leaves a lot to be desired. The only device we got to work with this seamlessly is the Sony Blu-Ray DVD player (go figure!). The RCA TV doesn't have all of the functionality that we need working correctly (like the input button!) and we haven't set it up yet with the amp. But with the limitations with the volume button only working with one device (the TV for us), I am not in any hurry to mess with the soft keys and program the amp volume that way. I am disappointed. Sony ""licensed"" this product but obviously just tested the PS4 portion. If you have a lot of other Sony equipment at home, this may work better for you.

B000AB603U,,2,"Personally I was heavily bored and disillusioned by Age of Mythology.  It had very little replay value for me, especially when human infantry are basically useless against Myth units.

Age of Empires III, rather than acting as a sequel to Age of Empires II, acts as a sequel to Age of Mythology.  The engine is pretty much exactly the same.  Perhaps thinking the ancients too stupid to build big buildings, all the buildings here are maybe 3 or 4 times the size of buildings in Age of Mythology, making the map seem very small and difficult to navigate as you seem to run out of space quickly.  Even ships look cartoonish simply by how massive they are in comparison to the puddle-sized river you've just built them into.

About the best improvements made from Age of Mythology is the population... you can have more than a 50 man army at one time here.

There is nothing else revolutionary here... it's the same old s-word with regards to real time strategy---civilians dig gold, hunt animals or farm, cut wood, build houses, build barracks, build church or mosque or temple, build infantry, mass them, attack, upgrade, build another base somewhere else, repeat.  The graphics look great, but they are highly unimpressive in battle... gunfire, cannon shots, explosions, are all unremarkable.  The only positive aspect I can say here is that the buildings actually look like they're taking damage when under fire---losing roof tiles, chunks of concrete and masonry crumbling off.

Everything else is just ordinary.  The sort of generic, unremarkable RTS of the next 3D generation, improving where Age of Mythology fumbled (that is, army battles), but breaking no new ground.

(Native Americans) Indians: They have some settlements littered around.  You build a trading post next to them and you can train some of their soldiers.  Mercenaries.  The good thing is they don't count towards your population.  Also you get a few upgrades that only give you a minor edge in battle.

In-depth Cities: Useless.  It does nothing.  You can't do anything with the cities.  Instead you get bonus cards, which give you little tiny gifts that don't turn the tide of the battle massively unless you've got nothing left.

Everything else is about the same old s-word you'd find in Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology, and Rise of Nations.  No innovation, no revolution, no increased challenge, nothing new.

B000BI3QK2,,5,"I mean, honestly.  This game is so huge and vast that if someone were to sit down, play it, ""beat it,"" and then go, gee I should review it, it would be time for the next one to come out.  Instead, I'll write a review that I will hopefully update as I progress incase my opinion on the game changes.  I've logged a few hours into it so far and right off the bat I know I'll like it.

To break it down succinctly before I ramble, if you've played Morrowind and enjoyed it, even a little, you are doing yourself a great disservice by not picking this up right now.  If you were disappointed at Morrowind because it was too big that you felt listless and didn't know what to do, pick this game up.  If you loved how open and free Morrowind was, pick it up right now.  If you've never played Morrowind, well, read on.

Right away, most of the complaints of Morrowind are addressed.  After spending a couple hours in the first dungeon/jail escape, you finally see the light of day and let me tell you, from then on, awe and excitement are around every corner.  But, unlike Morrowind, in controlled and, if you want them to be, small pieces.  Generally, there were two camps of people who played Morrowind: they loved it because it was so open/free that they could do anything they wanted; or, they hated it because they didn't know what to do because it was so open/free.

Oblivion takes the best of Morrowind (the openness) and makes it more accessible.  If you want to focus on the main quest, right as soon as you leave the dungeon there's a red flag on your compass and on your map showing where you need to go.  In fact, you can click on that town and instantly warp there, should you want to.  In Morrowind, it took a bit for the main story to actually appear.  In Oblivion you are thrust into the main story right from the beginning.  And, if you want, the story can be started right away and has some pretty exciting moments right away.

If you want to, instead, explore the world a bit, well go right ahead.  I did the second option, exploring a nearby fort that had catacombs filled with traps, skeletons and a ghost.  Tried my hand at pick-pocketing sleeping guards with unfortunate success.  Stumbled upon a bandit camp that didn't like me interrupting their probably nefarious deeds.

It's setup so that if you want to, you can very easily pursue the main quest, never get lost and know what you're doing.  However, you can also just set out on your own, kingdom be damned and spend the next 100 hours seeing the sights, exploring the 200+ dungeons, and scaling all 17 or so square miles of the land.  As an example, one of my friends immediately began the main quest.  He's now a good chunk of quests ahead of me in the quests.  I took the explorer route and spent the time looking around, finding the ruins and dungeons, joining the guilds etc.  Two totally different approaches, both easy to get into and fun to mess around with.

Character creation is similar to Morrowind.  There are a ton of races to choose from, about 21 classes (or you can create your own), 21 skill categories and a large handful of astral signs that give you bonuses.  For those who've played Morrowind, there's not much difference here.  Its all about choice.  How do you want to play.  Also included is a fantastic character editor where you can change different facets of your character to fit your desire.  Really cool.

Choosing your ""class"" is important in that it will define how you want to play your character.  You have 7 major skills that you can assign any of the 21 skills to.  Each ""kind"" of character (melee, stealth, magic) have 7 skills to choose from.  Whatever you put in your major skills determines your ""class"" and how you level, while the remaining 14 become minor skills that can be leveled up (at a slower rate) and don't contribute to your leveling.  Races give bonuses to skills and attributes as does the sign you end up choosing.

As you can tell, the game is about openness.  Do you want, be what you want.  To a lesser extent, Fable tried this with mixed results.  But not until this game have I seen so much openness and ability to do practically what you want.

NPCs are on a 24/7 clock.  Each one of the 1,000 NPCs in the game have varying levels of needs, desires and goals.  They will carry these out without regard to you.  Guards will catch NPC criminals, people will go out and hunt.  I've seen a guard attack a wolf that was bothering a passerby.  It all feels natural and as realistic as any game right now.  Mostly.  There are some sore spots.  The combat AI for any partners you have can be a joke.  Sometimes, they will just barrel forward without regard for the other monsters around you.  That can lead to very difficult situations as the AI guards round up more than they can handle, die, and then you have a messy situation on your hands.

Other sore spots include guards with ESP.  Apparently, if a person wakes up while being killed or isn't killed in one hit, the guard seemingly knows that murder is being committed.  And will rush right to where you are.  This has caused me a lot of consternation when I'm trying to finish a quest with guards who know not only that I'm a murderer but also exactly where I am.  And will continue to chase you forever.

The interface has been retooled.  The journal and your inventory is now much much more user-friendly.  Quests show up in a log and you can easily select which quest you want as your active quest.  Doing so immediately pops up a red marker where you need to go.  You won't get lost.  I will say its sometimes a little disappointing when an arrow appears over a ruin that the quest says you need to find.  Instead of following general directions, I know exactly where to find it.  That's a bit disappointing in that it takes away from the exploring portion of it.  Minor gripe, though.

The graphics also help promote this world.  Terrific, they really make Oblivion come to life.  From the trees in the background, to the tall weeds you pass through, everything is animated and created painstakingly beautifully.  Its a real world come to life in virtual form.  The physics are pretty decent.  I've caused skeletons to explode, people flying backwards with a well cast fireball, rolling down hills.  Sometimes, the close-ups of people are a little jarring because they don't look so realistic when you get up close and a lot of them look like they have uber-wrinkles or a skin problem.  Aliasing is practically non-existent.  When you get a horse, the very very very brief pauses in between loading the outworld area becomes a bit more noticeable because it seems to happen a bit more often.  Its still not in anyway shape or form to the detriment of the game and is completely understandable given that the world is so huge, but its there and noticeable.

The sound is also terrific.  The voice actors are pretty decent, the sound effects awesome and the music really well done.  Traveling through a thunderstorm really makes you feel like its raining, lightning and thundering.  The clash of steel on steel is exciting, sparks fly.

The game does stutter at times.  In the first dungeon, when I brought out a torch, the game paused briefly as it changed the light levels.  Not a huge problem by any means.  Placing spells on your directional pad hotkey can become a pain as you ready each spell.  Though, I love the fact I can wield a sword and a torch/shield AND cast spells at the same time.  Love it.  I guess there's some framerate issues, but I have barely noticed them at all.  There are some pop-ups with the shrubs etc in the distance but really when the game is generating all of this on the fly, I can forgive some very very very minor quibbles.

Overall, if you are a fan of RPGs, I don't know why you wouldn't like this game.  Whatever you bring to the table, it will match you.  Whether you want to get lost in a virtual world, discover catacombs that really feel like they've never been found before, just go after the main quest, buy and sell houses, try and become a mercantile genius or even become a vampire, everything is up to you.  You can do it all, or none of it.

I will say it's hard to be objective with a game that was seemingly crafted just for me.  I am usually willing to overlook minor faults etc when the end product is amazing.  Such is the case with Oblivion.  Everything about it are things I love.  I love the openness that is controlled in that I will never get lost.  I can't think of many games that give you so much freedom, but in such a way that you won't lose your way.  Absolutely terrific, there's nothing here that makes me not recommend it fully-heartedly for RPGers.

NOTE: I hesitate to even bring this up, but the game has been re-rated by the ESRB as of 3 May 2006.  For some reason, they have decided the amount of blood in the game is more fitting of a rated ""M for Mature (17+)"" game.  There is talk of a mod that will strip away the female character's top portion of the clothes.  Please know that this does not affect the Xbox 360 version of the game.

Nowadays, we're down to a day to a week at most in the vast majority of new games. Nevertheless, multiplayer is untouchable and the realism factor (on hardcore) is pretty intense, though I still think Battlefield:Bad Company wins the ""Best"" award.

B01EM9PLVC,,5,"As a Turtle Beach customer for more than a decade, Ive tested several iterations on my Xbox 360 and more recently on the Xbox One over the years. Ive not been all that 100 percent delighted with a few of those past models  but the Elite Pro headset has exceeded my expectations to date. In fact, it's the best headset I've tested yet for Xbox One in terms of overall sound quality for both gameplay and chat.

Pros:
* Sound quality is superb. Crisp, clear gameplay experience with a 360-degree experience. For example, youll hear an explosion behind you, to the right. Or hear an enemy creeping up on your left Plus the external noise blocking is impressive. I play in an active household and many times a lot is going on around me.
* Chat is nearly flawless. I don't always use chat, but when I do Ill be reaching for my Elite Pro. Equally important is being able to hear a little bit of my voice as I chat (much like the old-fashioned phone lines did). It makes a huge difference.
* Design. The placement of the mic, volume and other controls is perfect. Very user friendly. Fit is comfortable. My head is huge (7 3/4 hat) and when adjusted it fits great.
* No batteries required. This headset draws power from your controller. I haven't noticed any shortening of gameplay before it needs to be recharged. I usually pay a couple hours at a time.

Cons:

REMEMBER!! your'e in first person view, so its even more disturbing!!! first time i see this on a war game...thats creepy, too realistic for a videogame, it really takes you to the horror and makes you appreciatte what our soldiers go thru in the middle east. this is not a rambo or commando like videogame ,where you always prevail, in this game, the enemy don't give a rat's a#*  who you are. they will team on you, hunt you down, and give you a bulletbath. the way its supposed to be. real fighting.

why i don't give this a 5???????

- the impact of the bullets are too arcade: they really don't go with the realism of the game, i though i was playing, typing of the dead or something. i shot the enemy many times and no extra blood, no nothing, they just blink a little bit....( that sucks)..

- on single campaign, you almost don't have to anything ( just run): yup, the team does all the fighting for you, its almost like they don't let you or they don't want you to take a piece of the pie, always hogging over your targets like ( NO, MAN THATS MY TARGET, GET LOST , YOU SUCK!!!!!) that type of thing..its annoying, and it really makes you wanna go back to the rambolike games, where you kill everything that moves..( oh some ducks in the air, let me shoot em and get some health & the spread gun!!!!) ;)

B004K1EA5G,,5,"Although not a sequel, DOA Dimensions is a great ""compilation"" of Dead or Alive's lore and a good starting point for anyone looking to get into the series. It's the first Dead or alive on a portable (aside from the psp game which wasn't a fighting game) AND the first title on a Nintendo system. As a big fan of the series, whose main draw is racks 'n' reversals, I think this portable version is the best one yet.

Graphically it's one of the most detailed games on the 3DS system, with great animation and detailed modes. It's probably visually comparable to PS2's DOA Harcore, not quite reaching DOA 4's benchmark for the series, but there are some nice flourishes here and there (I like the visual flashes when connecting with strikes and new dynamic camera shots during throws).

The music hasn't changed. If you didn't like it before you won't like it now, but I like that the game retains all the classic DOA tracks, and the stereo sound comes through loud and clear on the 3DS. You can even change the spoken dialogue track from English to Japanese, and while the English track is passable, at least the option is there since part 4 lacked it.

The game tries it's best to take all the story elements from each game and meld them in a cohesive and comprehendable timeline in Chronicle mode, and for the most part succeeds. I did find that to do so they had to add a little bit which is a good thing. Fighting game storylines are crap for the most part so it's great Tecmo made an attempt to clear the confusion longtime fans may have had from one iteration to the next while trying to follow the story.

To be honest, the 3D effect is a cool feature on the 3DS but it was the last reason I wanted a 3DS, and although for games like Pilotwings it does enhance the gameplay, fighting games like DOA don't gain anything from it. The 3D is nice, with the visuals getting slightly sharper and the sense of depth increased, but the downside is the gameplay takes a hit, going from 60fps to 30fps. With the 3D off the game is smooth as butter and I found the pacing to be better than the previous games. Like I said, not having the 3D on won't make you miss much. The game is great without it and the feature can be shut off easily.

As for the fighting mechanics, the game is smooth like I stated before, and there are noticeable improvements. With each game added to the series they shortened the window of time with which you could activate a reversal. After mastering the system in 3, by the time 4 came around it was even shorter! I found myself relying on counter strike and fast combos because trying a reversal always left me open for hurt. Luckily, and most likely to lure in new players, the reversal system is less punishing and frustrating. I'd say it's about back to where it was in part 2. You still need good timing, but you won't be frustrated because of the need to pull off a counter at the millisecond an attack connects. Thank goodness!

Dead or Alive Dimensions is a great game for fans of the series and the best place to start for newbies IMO. I'd have given it 6 stars if Samus was a playable combatant :-( but I recommend it to fighting game fans, DOA fans, and those who own a 3DS and have played Street Fighter to death. It's the perfect tide-over until Dead or Alive 5 is announced!","05 24, 2011",A1C35JXH7C4ADU,Dvazquez5138,,Worthy addition to the DOA series,1306195200,False,,Video_Games

0002238594,,4,"This is a good book, it's just not my kind of book. I spent a long time reading it and even had to schedule my reading so I wouldn't fall behind and stop reading it like I do with many books I'm not really interested in. Well, it really picks up at around page 600. Before that there are a lot of political affairs and descriptions of military tactics, which will probably bore most people but not enough to stop reading altogether.
Towards the end, when the pace of the story does get faster, however, I found myself becoming more and more aggravated. I just couldn't stand the splitting dichotomy that my mind's eye reeled from. The technical facts and political background is flawless, perfect. This makes the whole book sound real throughout. Clancy could say that the President had a pet monkey and I'd believe him because he has such good ethos. But near the end of the book, these so carefully described political characters became such an annoying work of fiction I became aggravated.
I hope I'm not ruining the book for anyone, but at the end, the characters just become plain STUPID. Imagine reading for 600 pages about fairly intelligent people with their own goals and aspirations, then suddenly have them become mindless non-persons unable to think or act clearly. This is of course a major opinion on my part, but I just found the way the characters acted near the end impossible to believe and frustrating because they didn't fit into character at all nor were their actions realistic.
There are some positive points, however. After reading this, I have a lot more respect for people serving in the armed forces. It clearly gives a good perspective for what life in the military can be like, with ranks, commanders in chief, the chain of command, and trying to follow superiors. The dialogue was entertaining and the character interactions were believable, but Tom Clancy could do away with the constant references to sexually-pleasing women every 60 pages or so.

Story- A+, Prose- A, Dialogue- A+, Romance- A, Action- A, Plot- A+.

This is a great book in a wonderful series, things heat up and plots get even more interesting with the addition of new characters and the return of at least one dead one!

The only real negative for me is the lack of action thought-out the series, more combat would heighten the story, especial since this is a story of knights and civil war.

This Series, ""Song of Fire ad Ice,"" is by far the best modern fantasy written today, period! In a rich and vibrant fantasy world, George R. R. Martin, creates a complex and intricate story of war, intrigue, and betrayal that is similar to the historical War of the Roses, but only much grander, and vastly more compelling.

The story has something for everyone, mystery, romance, and action, but even more it creates a reality that is believable, with characters that seem real to live, some you like, some you loath, but all wonderfully interesting!

Main Characters:

Bran Stark: very likable young guy, has a thing for dire wolves, a shaman in training?
Jon Snow: warrior hero and all around good guy.
Ser Jaime Lannister: ""The King Slayer,"" arrogant, amoral, reckless, but very amusing, and possibly finding his soul!
Cersei Lannister: ""The Queen Regent,"" ambitious, willful, conniving, promiscuous, and deviously wicked, a character you love to hate.
Tyrion Lannister: ""The Dwarf,"" shrewd, educated, and calculating, but with a hart [and tounge] that gets him into trouble.
Lord Petyr Baelish: called ""Littlefinger,"" a devious snake [?], and master manipulator!
Daenerys Targaryen: the dragon Queen, too nice but learning.
Brienne: the Maid of Tarth, an ugly warrior girl.
Sansa Stark: unfortunately a very boring character.
Arya Stark: dull and unlikable, who's going in a strange and too dark plot line.
Samwell Tarrly: fat Sam of the Night Watch, likable, intelligent, and caring, what's he doing in this story!
Victarion Greyjoy: ""The Iron Captain,"" Reaver ot the seas. Dull so far, but less so than his brothers, his character has lots of potential.
Arianne Martell: beautiful, hot blooded, sexy, she is new to this book and really spices up the story! Her cousins the Sand Snakes need a greater role, hot chicks that like to kill, wow!

There is some violence, yet is no more than many comparable works, less than ""The Return of the King,"" by JRRT, and it certainly fits into a medieval fantasy war story.

The sexual content touches on adult themes, but it is not anywhere as graphic as most aimed at an adult audience, anyone over the age of 16 should be able to handle this book. In fact the most disturbing sexual content in books 1 thru 4 is a retelling of an event that happens years before the events of the story.

0007284241,,4,"One of my favorite aspects of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings books is the completeness of the world that he created.  I never cease to be amazed by the history and lore that infuse those books, such that the reader feels that they must surely be a true history of some people, somewhere.  Thus, The Silmarillion came as no surprise to me.  For most of his life, Tolkien kept hundreds of notebooks full of his imagined backstory about the inhabitants of Middle Earth, for his own fun and reference while writing, and on the assumption that someday he would pull them into publishable form.  After his death, his son, Christopher took on the task.

Parts of the beginning of the book read like the ""begats"" from the Old Testament of the Bible, listing a mind-blowing profusion of characters and their roles.  I would likely have tossed the book aside had it not been the monthly read for the high school club I supervise.  Then it would settle into a marvelous tale reminiscent of Nordic myth.  Only to stop again with a geographical study of such yawn-inducing detail that you could follow step by step on the kindly included map.  Only for my students did I persevere.

After throwing so many names and places at you, and you should be so lucky as to only have to learn one name for each character and local-they all have at least two or three (Elves, Dwarves, and humans all give a single entity their own monikers in their own languages-for that matter, even those three races are given numerous names), Tolkien does bring it round to useful purpose in the end.  Keep in mind that there are maps, genealogical charts, and a complete list of characters in the back of the book, and press forward without worrying if you can not keep it all straight, because once past those sections, you are in for an adventure through the depths of Tolkien's imagination.

The narrative hits its stride about a hundred pages in and carries the reader willingly along through the trials and triumphs of the various races and individuals. Christopher Tolkien did a masterful job of organizing his father's writings; superb editing is apparent because the motivations and shifting allegiances are clearly delineated-despite the massive cast and histories of various peoples, I never felt lost in the shuffle.

As you read The Silmarillion another side of Tolkien also takes shape in your mind.  In addition to the creator of fantastical worlds and tense plot lines, the theological and philosophical sides of the man become readily apparent within the souls of his characters.  I loved seeing the moral and ethical dilemmas into which he plunged his characters and watching how he resolved them, as it spoke volumes about the author's personal thought processes.

As difficult as the first third of the book was to get through, I would definitely call it worth it for fans of The Lord of the Rings.  I look forward to revisiting those books with a new found knowledge of the ""history"" of the characters, as many things which are alluded to in The Ring are explained in The Silmarillion.  Fans of the trilogy will begin to recognize many familiar names and places as they near the end of The Silmarillion.  And the last two thirds of the book was sheer, epic adventure as only Tolkien can deliver.  The writing style was very interesting as well, very much in the style of Scandinavian myth and lore, and quite different from the style in which his other books were written.

This is really not a book for those who disliked The Lord of the Rings, but a fun read for fans, or a great starting point for those who have yet to read the other books and would like to begin with a little backstory.","12 8, 2011",A2F173B4LMOJZ4,lit-in-the-last-frontier,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},The backstory behind the masterpiece,1323302400,False,,Books

My views are based on actual practice experience and now my views are deftly backed up by this wonderful book. From the first time I read a review on it and followed its progress I knew it would do well and it did, it won the Pulizer as it should. The author, an oncologist himself did write something unique here. A look at the history of and development of the cancer treatments and difficulties we know right up to today. He did his research and knows his stuff and in between rounds and after work was able to put together an expansive look and explanation of just what we are dealing with here. Yes, there are external factors which cause or contribute but mostly it is a game of chance with your genes. One wrong switch flips on because of a mutant gene and the cascade begins. Well, it is really not that simple but then again in a complete reductionist view, it can be. Life it seems is really a crap shoot when it comes to cancer, smoke, drink, eat fatty foods and enjoy your bar-b-que because you just might live to 100. Run, exersize, eat the right foods,live well,don't smoke and you could be dead by 40 from untreatable cancer of whatever. Some things can be handled nicely by medicine and some despite surgery,chemo,prayer, whatever, too bad your dead. The book is very inclusive and has something for everyone as it can be quite technical at times and rather pedestrian at others. One thing I will say is that it was well written  for someone with no experience writing before. It will appeal to all walks of life, from the medical clinician to the nurse on the floor to the common person curious about a very taboo topic even today. For those who want to know more about this thing we call cancer and just why with all the money thrown at it we have yet to make truly significant inroads by way of a cure. It does drag somewhat in the middle but stay with it because it will leave you with a better overall knowledge of the subject and will hopefully enlighten you and give those who do suffer hope. This is a must read for medical or nursing students interested in Oncology. For the general public, an explanation and examination of what was and what is, far,far, better than anything our Surgeon General could deliver. Truly, one of the better books yet written on this thorny subject recently and probably will be for some time to come. As was said above,cancer is and always was with us, perhaps it is natures way of thinning the herd from within our bodies rather than from without. We can define it, slow it,put it into remission status,even some can be eliminated almost to the point where we believe that is it gone forever but the lingering fear of return is always present isn't it?. What we can't do unfortunately is say we can eradicate it from the human condition once and forever. Early in my career I worked on an oncology floor and found it to be utterly depressing, full of pain, suffering,heartache and difficult in many ways. You work and work but the result was always the same, death. Sometimes quick,sometimes lingering and slow. True, there are some successes but once cancer has you in its grip, well,the outcome is not always good. Those who work in this field have my utmost respect  and admiration as it is one of the most difficult jobs I've ever experienced. This book will show you why that is so in a broad and comprehensive manner.","02 25, 2012",A22T1OEKRYL3T4,Richard Dicanio,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},A Fresh and Winning Look at Something We May Never be Able to Eradicate Despite Our Best Efforts,1330128000,False,,Books

Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.

The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.

The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.

Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.

Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.

Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it.","06 3, 2008",A1M7VDZ49ADI0J,Cowabunga,{'Format:': ' Mass Market Paperback'},Frustratingly realistic.,1212451200,False,2,Books

000711835X,,5,"There is so much that can be said about The Lord of the Rings...  The power of the book for me was in the piercing spiritual insights into the challenges and choices of how to face despair.  Against overwhelming odds, and a sure knowledge of the HOPELESSNESS of all possible action, Denethor, who was so mighty and noble and wise and therefore should have been one to have more self-confidence, chose to succumb to the despair and committed suicide.  In contrast the two hobbitts, by nature weak and frail and therefore with even less hope than one as mighty as Denethor, took into account the utter hopelessness of their situation but chose to go forward anyway. This is where the value of Tolkien's own experience shows: he who had been called away from his home to a hopeless war, away from the one he loved, held a keen understanding of the paths that Sam and Frodo walked, and the darkness that Denethor faced...

The height of spiritual courage is conveyed in a few brief sentences that tell of Sam's progression while on the road in Mordor from hopelessness into a resolve that is made heroic by its utter selflessness... ""But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new strength. Sam's plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as the will hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue."" (p. 934)

The book reveals the hopelessness of the road in Mordor in a way that the movie cannot do... the dread and despair of that journey as they realize there is no hope of return, and little hope of success ahead.

After struggling with the despair Sam's resolve turns to steel and he reaches the point where he rises above the despair.

""With a gasp Frodo cast himself on the ground. Sam sat by him. To his surprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more debates disturbed his mind. He knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them. His will was set and only death would break it."" (p. 940)

There are many worthwhile insights in the book, but the single phrase: ""He knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them,"" contains by far the most profound of all Tolkien's insights.  It reflects the stance I believe that Tolkien took during his own dark days in the trenches, far from home, far from the hopes of his life.  The lines he composed ""Cold be heart and hand and bones, cold be travellers far from home... they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead"" were very apt and effectively conveyed the grim horror of being alone in the darkness far from home and hope that are meant to be conveyed as well in the dreaded journey of the hobbits to finish their task in Mordor.

It is human nature to give in to despair.  It is harder still to forge on despite being familiar with ""all the arguments of despair"".  The reality is that there are some who choose this path and then never waiver, even as they face their own deaths.  Essentially, Tolkien is describing the highest achievement of the human spirit, which is to carry the heaviest burden WITHOUT HOPE, and yet not renounce the journey, in essence to renounce self and all self interest as secondary and less important in comparison to fulfilling the heroic quest. This was the point that Sam reached, and ironically, it led to ""a new strength"" for Sam.  Denethor could not renounce self, and his insistence on clinging to his self interest bound him as a slave to despair, just as the wringraiths were bound as slaves to the darkness of Sauron, as all others who could not renounce the rings(self-empowerment) were bound to the same doom.

It is interesting to note that the same struggle between self-interest/self-preservation and self-sacrifice in service of the soul's higher calling is an age old struggle and well recognized in the ancient books of the world (John 12:27 ""Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour."")

Tolkien offers a whole world of amazing complexity and depth; this is just a scratch of the surface.

Tolkien's story is a great tale when read simply for the story itself, underneath the story lies a profound metaphor which taps into great reservoirs of spiritual truth.

Well worth the read.","11 12, 2006",A1AAX8VFARAUMA,Xue Tian,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},arguing with despair,1163289600,False,9,Books
0006496431,,5,"The Little House is a remarkable gem of a psychological thriller.  It makes even the most normal, everyday events seem sinister and riveting.
The plot focuses on Ruth who is talked into starting a family by her husband and living down the road from his upper class parents in the country.  Then the nightmare unfolds.  The book is a masterpiece of claustrophobia as Ruth's in-laws intrude more and more into her life.  All throughout the book I felt tense and unsettled - just as I love to be when I am reading a thriller.  I could absolutely empathise with Ruth and as her situation got worse and worse I was routing for her all the way.
Ruth is a delightful, yet in some ways tragic character.  She is a successful journalist and yet her past has meant that she is needy and desperately seeking love.  She thinks she has found a family which she can belong to at long last in her in-laws but what she fails to realise is that they want to control her.  The mother in-law, father in-law, and Ruth's husband Patrick are chillingly plausible and well developed.  The beauty in this novel is that unlike in many other psychological thriller's these three characters are not evil, they truly believe they are doing the best for Ruth and themselves - even as they push her further and further towards the limits of her own sanity.
Overall The Little House is a fantastic study of relationships between a woman and her in-laws and how the ordinary things can lead someone to madness, and to do the most unspeakable things.  The Little House's packs a hard, chilling punch, especially as the ending is so unexpected and compelling.  I would recommend this book unreservedly.

I lost interest because the excitement within the story is gone. It feels like the author knew how he wanted the series to end, and how he wanted to start it, but had no great ideas for the middle.  The prose is slow and unenthusiastic, and the characters have not developed at all. Hobbits are reluctant heroes to the point that I wonder why they are continuing such a treacherous quest.  I feel almost pained to read about these gentle, naive hobbits getting into trouble time and again.  I feel bad for them, and wish they would give their quest to someone more competent and enthusiastic. I started this book right after I finished the first, and I think that was a mistake.  If you want to buy this book to continue the series, put it on your wish list and wait a month.

0006499163,,5,"Read this book very carefully, especially if you are committed to reading all 20 volumes.  IMHO, it is the best book of the series. In book one (""Master and Commander""), I assumed that Maturin was a minor character who would not appear again.  I thought he was a gay geek, and that his mysterious, solitary, on-shore expedition was of a carnal nature; little did I realize the true nature of either Maturin or the trip.
This second book focuses on developing the Maturin character as a spy; a sophisticated man of wealth, background, and education; a lifelong drug addict; and a nerdy womanizer - sort of an 19th century cross between James Bond and Bill Gates.
Chapter 4 is the most bizarre chapter in the entire series.  I am still going on the assumption that the escape-across-France-in-a-bear-costume was really just another opium vision of Maturin's.
The books that follow this one vary greatly in quality of plot; some are excellent, some seem to be virtually plotless narratives, but all are worth reading.

0007174098,,2,"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha's long and illustrious career (1972) would have been better left on the cutting room floor.  It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying ""Murder at the Vicarage"" which was written in 1927.  The comparison was depressing.
Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide.  Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction.  Many people are interviewed (the ""elephants"" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself.  Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not ""herrings"" at all. They are giant signposts.  Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago.  The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.
According to the publisher, ""Elephants Can Remember"" was originally published as ""Five Little Pigs.""  I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice.  There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title ""Queen of Crime.""","08 1, 2002",A1HS9F7J51E9CB,sweetmolly,{'Format:': ' Mass Market Paperback'},Old Sins Cast Long Shadows,1028160000,False,12,Books

It is an interesting device and provides a different perspective on Mr Reagan who is an enigma to a person of my generation.  What is he like??  Even now, when you hear people talk of the President, there is a vagueness about what he is like as a person.  I really would like to find out more about his personality and what made him tick.  How did a Hollywood B-actor get to be the leader of the world?
For such an opaque personality, nothing would have been more tedious than to have read a biography of Reagan that is as dry as sandpaper, listing facts like phone-book numbers.  I think the author has tried to give us a sense of what the character of the man is like and on this I think Morris has succeeded moderately well.
I did, however, find the many sections of the book dealing with the fictional life of the narrator and his imaginary conversations with his pals on subjects not remotely connected to Ronald Reagan distracted from the book.  Eventually I had to skim read these passages as I found them too frustrating. I think Morris's editor was looking elsewhere, or was consumed with panic over the narration technique, and failed to take a decent red pen to the text itself where this merited it.
Like another critic below, I find myself at the end of this book wanting to know more about the enigmatic Mr Reagan and fear I will have to buy one of those sandpaper books in order to do it.  It is a real shame because otherwise I think Mr Morris deserves praise for presenting a view of Mr Reagan to us that might otherwise have been missed.

0001048767,,5,"A man and a woman meet. They outwardly seem to despise each other (or at least find each other annoying), but we know that deep down they're in love and just need a jolt to realize it.

That's one of the more popular romance tropes -- everybody from Jane Austen to anime has used it. But the original feisty Will They Or Won't They couple was Beatrice and Benedick in William Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" -- and while the plot supposedly revolves around an evil plot to discredit Beatrice's cousin, it's more fun to watch the two B's slinging insults and falling in love.

Spanish prince Don Pedro has defeated his evil illegitimate brother Don John, and is coming to the estate of Leonato for a visit -- along  with his entourage, his disgraced brother, and his officers Benedick and Claudio. Claudio soon falls in love with Leonato's daughter Hero, but Hero's cousin Beatrice has the opposite reaction -- ""there is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her.""

Soon Hero and Claudio are happily engaged, and Don Pedro decides to matchmake Beatrice and Benedick -- and after a tidy bit of manipulation, the acid-tongued pair fall madly in love. But Don John spins up a malicious deception that tears apart the love between Claudio and Hero, creates a rift between Leonato and Don Pedro, and leaves it doubtful that anyone will live happily ever after...

""Much Ado About Nothing"" is one of Shakespeare's finest comedies, mainly because it often hangs off his clever wordplay and zinger-filled dialogue (""I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books."" ""No; and he were, I would burn my study""). There's even some hilarious scenes where Benedick bemoans the difficulty of writing rhyming poetry.

Technically the plot revolves around the impending wedding of Hero and Claudio, as well as Don John's attempts to derail the whole affair -- resulting on some painfully raw scenes (such as Beatrice freaking out after Hero's public disgrace), as well as some goofy ones... like any scene involving the absurd Dogberry. But Beatrice and Benedick are undeniably the centerpiece of the story, as well as the most likable characters.

Because they're so witty and prickly, Beatrice and Benedick are loads of fun -- they start off violently against getting married and content to just lob insults at each other. And even after they fall in love, Shakespeare keeps their wit intact (""Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably""). Don Pedro is a good supporting character, a wise and kind prince who enjoys meddling in other people's romantic affairs.

The downsides: we never really get a REASON for Don John to be such a jerk. And Claudio comes across as a puffed up adolescent with a crush, especially since he deliberately humiliates Hero in public to salvage his ego... and for some reason, she doesn't hate him for the maliciousness.

""Much Ado About Nothing"" is one of Shakespeare's best comedies -- a tennis match of zingers and witticisms, wrapped around a solid plot about deception and lies.","05 29, 2010",A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,E. A.

It comes from the years when Shakespeare discovered his own sexuality, and discovered that perhaps he did not have to live under the shadow of his friend Marlowe--and his inventiveness and poetry mushroomed. The low rating comes from the low level of scholarship associated with this addition. The careful work that R. W. David did for the Arden Second Series has been discarded, and the Introduction is frothy and gossipy. The editing of the text itself is bad. The basis for the play is mankind's expulsion from the garden of Eden. H. R. Woudhuysen must not understand the play very well, because he eliminated Costard's joke ""Gardon! Remuneration!"" which condenses the idea of our punishment in being thrown out of the garden into two words.  Woudhuysen went to, I think, the Third Folio, to find Costard saying ""Guerdon! Remuneration!"" which of course eliminates the joke and mars the play. I regret criticizing anybody else's hard work, but the Arden Second Series edition is more reliable and informative.","10 5, 2015",A1QSKOKPBT0BER,Deloss Brown,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},Buy the Arden Second Series Instead,1444003200,True,9,Books

0007141424,,3,"After finishing 'Gathering Blue', I immediately started 'Messenger'. I had such high hopes for this book since it was the end of the series. However, it left me with so many questions.

It was nice to get some closer on Jonas, and to find out what became of his community, but what about his brother Gabe? He's mentioned in a single sentence out of the whole book. And Kira's village (Matty's old one)...things there have changed, people are nicer and more caring towards one another, but WHY? What brought about the change?

My biggest two questions though involve the Trade Mart, and Forrest. What was actually going on a Trade mart? Yes, people were obviously trading their souls for items, but HOW? Was the Trademaster (who was never described) some sort of magician? What was in his book?? As for Forrest, why was it suddenly becoming hostile? What changed? Also (and this is a bit of a side note), I thought it strange that Matty had this healing gift, but never healed the Seer. Even before he left for his journey to get Kira, he could have given the man his sight back.

Overall, I'm satisfied, but also slightly disappointed. 'The Giver' has been a favorite book of mine since I read it for the first time 14 years ago, and 'Gathering Blue' was also a good book, but 'Messenger' was a bit of a let down.

0007145594,,1,"The most engaging thing about this book is trying to comprehend how anyone could give it 4 or 5 stars (I am being generous to those who gave it 3 or 2 stars).  What system are we using here.  There are only five choices 1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star and 5 star.  1 star should represent the most horrible piece of crud you have ever read.  A book so painful that you would not give it to your worst enemy to read.  5 stars should be the best of the best.  Under no circumstances could anyone who actually read this latest tripe from Terry Goodkind give this more than 3 stars.  In fact, I honestly believe that the reviewers who gave this book 4 or five stars are either in grade school or are brain dead.
Even if we compared Naked Empire with the other books in this series it is asinine to give this five or four stars compared to Wizard's First Rule which actually does deserve a five star rating.  At most I would accept someone giving this book three stars.
Any other basis for critiquing this book would not even allow for 3 stars.  Grammatically this book is either a rough draft in need of editing or it was written by a moron.  Structurally the plot is incredibly thin and Terry has gotten into the bad habit of now resolving all problems (no matter how insurmountable) within the last 30-60 pages of the book.  For example, how do you solve the problem of having your heroes completly surrounded by thousands of enemy troops.  Answer: have two of the series most powerful magic users show up out of the blue and destroy everyone in the blink of an eye.  Ridiculous.

For any of you who are fortunate enough not to have bought this book yet I will spare you the pain.

000711835X,,5,"This book is about the journey of Frodo and his companions.  Frodo is a hobbit who lives in the Shire with his uncle, Bilbo Baggins.  On the day that the book starts, it is Frodo's and Bilbo's birthday and Bilbo celebrates with a grand party with presents for all.  In the middle of the party Bilbo vanishes and leaves a ring for Frodo.  This ring is the beginning of his journey and the end of his normal life.  Frodo learns of the power of the ring and of the dark forces of Sauron, who wish to steal the ring and slay its bearer.  Frodo begins his journey with his companion Sam Gamgee.  In the rest of the book, they acquire more alliances and companions to aid them in their quest to destroy the ring and save middle earth, and this is known as The Fellowship of the Ring.

  This book is recommended because of the suspense of Frodo's journey and the story behind it.  There are many good chapters in the book, and it will rarely leave readers with a boring moment. Readers may wish that the book had is a bit more detail on the story behind the Ring Wraiths of Mordor.  The book is a bit hard to understand if read through  too fast because of the old style speech that some of the characters use.  In some chapters, readers must really pay attention,  such as The Council of Elrond, because of the detail Tolkien goes into and what will become of the ring.  If one likes fantasy books with elves, orcs, goblins and wizards, read this book.","01 30, 2002",A3A0XNRIPJ08DW,Jordan Covarrubias,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},The ultimate journey,1012348800,False,,Books

0007267568,,5,"Dean Koontz is a master writer and one of the best authors of suspenseful thrillers. His books generally make the best seller lists, and properly so.
This volume tells the tale of a young successful and very wealthy businessman Ryan Perry who required a heart transplant. Prior to having the transplant or even knowing he needed one, he falls in love with his beautiful girl friend Samantha and he proposes marriage. She turns him down. She tells him that he has a fault. Ryan does not know what she means. Is there something wrong with him? If so what does Samantha see that he is unable to see? Or, perhaps, it is just the opposite; Samantha is telling him that there is something wrong with her. If so, what is it? Why, if there is something wrong with her, did she continue a relationship with him for so long and then reject him?
Samantha is writing her first novel. When Ryan discusses it with her, without going into its details, she tells him that good novels have a subtext. Readers need to read the surface story, and people who can mine the tale for its subtext, get more, much more out of it. Is Samantha writing about him, Ryan wonders, and our relationship? What is she revealing in the novel that she isn't telling me?
Ryan is puzzled. Samantha tells him that she loves him and knows that he loves her. Since this is so, why not marry him. Ryan decides to investigate her. What he finds out about her mother and her mother's boy friend shock him. The boy friend is involved in many assisted deaths. Ryan finds the picture of Samantha's twin sister among the pictures of assisted suicides. Is Samantha somehow suggesting that she started her relationship with him to later hand him over to her mother's paramour? If so, why? It seems clear to Ryan that there is some kind of conspiracy, but what is it?
Then he discovers that he needs a new heart and he begins to suspect virtually everything. His friend a doctor refers him to a specialist. Ryan is placed on a list for donors. But is this doctor really helping him? Against Samantha's warning and without telling her Ryan switches surgeons. The new surgeon places him on a new list, and within a month he is shipped to an oriental country for a replacement heart. The surgery is very costly but successful, and Ryan never felt better. But then his life becomes complicated and he is threatened.
Ryan, being very rich, lives in a highly protected house. There are all kinds of alarms, videos of people coming near the house, hidden rooms, codes, locks; yet someone somehow enters his house and leaves candies on his pillow on which there are the words, ""Your heart belongs to me."" The intruder is able to get passed all the security apparatus, and is even able to wipe out the incursion in the video. Soon, he finds out that the intruder is an oriental woman who shows that she can do what she wants with him by stabbing him, enough to hurt but not kill, yet. But she promises to kill him.
Ryan finds out that the woman is a twin of the woman whose heart he took, and she wants it back. This is another twin; the first being Samantha's sister. Are twins somehow a key to the mystery?
There are many other seeming supernatural events in the tale, which moves along excitingly and is well worth reading.","09 4, 2009",A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,Israel Drazin,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},Very entertaining,1252022400,False,2,Books

0006755224,,5,"Rumor has it that the number one least appreciated and fantastic fantasy writer of the English language in the United States is Diana Wynne Jones.  Rumor also has it that one of her best written works (little known) is the delightful ""Dogsbody"".  Truthfully, I hadn't heard anyone give this book any credit until I decided to work my way through all the great unknown children's books.  This book falls squarely into the slightly more adult kids fare (as will be explained) but that doesn't stop it from being a really wonderful work of art.  This is one of those book gems one often wishes they could find but so rarely do.  Beautifully written, it's a classic.

The great Dog Star Sirius is on trial for his life.  Though we puny humans don't know it, the stars, planets, and even satellites have their own distinct lives and actions.  When Sirius finds that he has been falsely accused of murder, he is sentenced to live out his days as a real honest-to-goodness dog on Earth.  If he can locate a weapon of mass destruction belonging to the Luminaries that has fallen to earth and retrieve it in his doggie state, he will be returned to his original form.  This is not only a story about learning to control one's own actions, but a touching tale of a girl and her not so ordinary pup.

Originally published in 1975, the book is one of those stories that make you sit up and say, ""huh?"".  Where did Diana Wynne Jones even get this idea?  Reading through this book I got the same feeling I received as when I saw the movie, ""Being John Malcovich"".  Mainly, a sense of ""how could a person think this up?"".  As it is, the book could easily have fallen victim to its fantasy elements.  Instead, it's a wonderful tale of pet love.  Both dogs AND cats get a fair amount of attention in this tale, so don't fear.  Just because the hero is in a dog's body, that doesn't mean felines are naturally made out to be the villains.  What's really a joy about this book is the amount of time the author spends on Sirius's dog nature verses his luminary nature.  From interesting smells to a female dog in heat (nothing graphic occurs, so qwitcherbelliaking) we truly understand what a canine must go through every day of its life.

Jones is just as canny with her human subjects as she is with her animal or ethereal ones as well.  Sirius is rescued as a puppy from a river by a young Northern Irish girl named Kathleen.  The girl lives with her aunt, uncle and two cousins (all of whom are English).  Though her cousins act as boys are won't to do (they're neither villains nor saints, that's for sure) and her uncle is kindly but distant, Kathleen's aunt is the real terror in her life.  A prejudiced mean Irish-hating creature, she takes a special delight in tormenting her unwanted charge.  Only Sirius's presence keeps Kathleen happy and sane, though the threat of being put to sleep hangs over his head as long as Aunt Duffie is around.  What I loved about all the people in this story was their capacity for change.  Basil, the elder of Kathleen's two cousins, appears to be a real beast at first.  He teases Sirius and occasionally lashes out at him, but it's clear that this is just the boy's misguided way of showing affection.  No one is irredeemable in this book (though two rougue luminaries hunting for Sirius in his dog-form come close).  Even the mythical being that appears at the end of the tale (Earth's darkest son) inspires more pity than fear.

If you want a good dog story and you don't mind a bit of fantasy as well, then I just can't recommend ""Dogsbody"" enough.  Somebody ought to film this book.  Better yet, author Jones should seriously consider writing a sequel.  Though to the best of my knowledge no sequel was ever written, this book leaves itself wide-open for future furry adventures.  For any kid who has ever loved an animal, this book is a standout, a knockout, and a sure-fire crowd pleaser.  The best I've read in a long long time.","05 26, 2004",AMX0PJKV4PPNJ,E. R.

0007217838,,5,"""Initiate's Trial"" is the ninth book of Janny Wurts's ""Wars of Light and Shadow;""  the book mentioned in the review title, ""Warhost of Vastmark,"" is the third book in the series, and belongs to Series Arc II, Ships of Merior.

Though these two titles are six series books apart, the opening chapter of each book connects the two books together.  An ongoing crisis in the fantasy world of this series, is directly addressed in these opening chapters, but from two points of view and upon occasions separated by over two centuries.  I won't spoil the details any further.  But ""Initiate's Trial"" 's opening chapter is the fulfillment of the opening chapter of ""Warhost of Vastmark,"" and the combined writings are vital to an understanding and appreciation of the entire saga.

For what it's worth, in my opinion, this is a series of books whose beginning entries are uncompromising, exacting, downright forbidding to the new reader; and the books improve as the series goes on.  ""Warhost of Vastmark"", for example, is a book which I much prefer to book one, ""Curse of the Mistwraith;""  I just think it's better written and more readily grasped.

What I find most touching about ""Initiate's Trial""  is the depth and intensity of the insights into the effect of violence and war upon the human psyche, and the descriptions of post-traumatic stress.  Not light reading, and for me each book has required much re-reading in order to absorb its content and meaning.  Although I find some of the series entries frustrating and awkward, the saga as a whole draws me back in again and again.","10 27, 2014",A186LSLO16M3MY,bmuse,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},"Read ""Warhost of Vastmark"", first chapter, for background.

0002247399,,5,"Like the preceding books in this amazing series, ""A Dance with Dragons"" is rich, twisty, gritty, and totally engrossing. It comes through on Martin's promise to return the reader to the lifelines of major characters that were largely missing from ""Feast of Crows"". Unfortunately, many of the major characters that are most appealing (at least to me) remain at points in their lives where they are not involved in the central picture in any discernable way. In other words, although things continue to happen in their lives, they are not moving the overall picture forward. (I cannot get specific here, without spoiling the story for someone...)

I am also unhappy to say that this book, like the others in this series, ends without an ending. In some great series, the author manages not only to write an overall story arc that ends satisfyingly, but also manages to make each book independent, and satisfyingly ended unto themselves. (Barbara Hambly's series that begins with ""Dragonsbane"" comes to mind as a magnificent example. Sharon Shinn's Archangel series is another example, though Hambly, I have to say, is the writer with far greater ""range"".) When a reader already knows that it may be multiple years before the next book, that's downright cruel!

0003302245,,5,"I'd never read Dracula before so it made a fun Halloween treat.  I tried to read it ""fresh""...to shun what I ""knew"" from all the media and pop-culture references that are nearly impossible to avoid.

While it was difficult (impossible?) to fully forget all the things that culture has thrust on me, I did try to envision what this book would have been like if I'd read it 100+ years ago when it was originally published.  While it shares many elements of the graphic novels and general horror writing of the time, it is certainly more ""terrifying"" than much of the other horror writing I've read from that era (which isn't saying a whole lot since I haven't read a ton).  For the era, this novel seemed to me startlingly graphic in terms of describing the horrors encountered by the main characters.  Compared to the gothic novels I've read, this is definitely more creepy.  It reminded me a lot of the eerie, creepy horror of some of Poe's works.

The writing style was a little different than I imagined.  It's set up as an epistolary novel with the narrative coming from multiple points of view as written after the fact in diaries, letters and even some newspaper clippings and commercial documents (ships logs, etc).  Thus, we are somewhat distanced from the action of the story, but we also get it from a variety of perspectives and with multiple different voices.  Some of the voices were very similar to one another and hard to distinguish.  The most distinguishable was Van Helsing who was actually written with a very strong dialect that sometimes annoyed me.

I definitely applaud the attention to detail in this book.  The descriptions of Dracula's castle and (later) the various homes/parks/streets in England were very vivid and easy to picture.  Even more engaging were the details brought to life through the emotional turmoil of the characters.  Reading the diary of Jonathan Harker, I could completely envision his growing terror throughout his stay at the castle.  I also really liked the detail and interaction in the letters between Mina and Lucy.

There were a number of times where I wanted the story to ""hurry up"" but when I sat back and read the novel without the cultural baggage of a world that's  grown up with the vampire/Dracula mythos, I felt myself very content to move along at a slower pace.  Not only did I find myself enjoying the methodical unraveling of the mystery and the descriptions of the Undead, but I also found that the slower pacing created a greater sense of anxiety and apprehension.

I only had a couple of minor complaints that stayed with me after finishing the book.

First and foremost, I wanted much more interaction with Dracula.  There was a ton of build up and a lot of ""off stage"" action implying what Dracula had done and what he was doing.  We saw him with some regularity early on but in those instances he was still more of an enigma than a source of horror.  There were only a very few scenes in which we actually came face-to-face with him as evil antagonist.  Furthermore, each of these confrontations was usually over very quickly.  Even the final confrontation was concluded quickly.  I appreciate that the novel's form makes it impossible for us to see things from his point of view or actually observe his actions off-stage (unless perhaps he had left his own journal), but I would have appreciated more encounters or perhaps lengthier encounters.  Instead, most of what we learn about his power and abilities come in short snippets followed by explanations from Van Helsing.

My second complaint had to do with Dr. Seward and Renfield.  We have Deward's diary which provides information as to Renfield's strange behavior and his unusual outbursts.  While I will grant that the chronology of things makes it difficult/impossible for Seward to piece together what's going on, it seems that there were a number of times where Seward should have sought more information but didn't (such as when Renfield escapes and runs to a certain home...even with his rantings and ravings and the strange workmen hauling boxes of dirt, Seward doesn't bother to investigate the owner of the home...I would think that it might be worthwhile to see if there was a particular reason why an escaped lunatic ran to a very particular home after escaping).  In spit of Seward's education and experience, it seems that he let a number of threads fall away.  Perhaps this is part of the nature of working in a sanitarium in the 1800s.

All in all, I really enjoyed finally reading this book.  With it's huge influence on modern culture, I definitely recommend checking it out and getting to know this original and exciting work.  Be prepared for a bit slower pace but if you put yourself in the mind of a reader in the early 1900s and try to distance yourself from the cultural baggage, I think you'll be in for a very creepy ride.

B0008ENZYG,,2,"On behalf of my Big-Tall man, I have no idea what Lee is playing at with the sizing.  I copied the tag info verbatim from the pair of 54/30s he has that are falling off him.  Then I ordered 50/30s, thinking they'd be comfy...  Length, leg width, construction, and fabric quality are all fine.  The waist was so small that it was more like a 44 or 46 than a 50...

Fine.  I returned those (both pairs, different colors,) and re-ordered.  52/30s this time, thinking maybe they'd split the difference between the stupid-small 50s and the falling-off 54s.  The 52s are STILL too small, behaving like -maybe- 46s.

He's currently wearing Levi's 48/32s; they're snug, (and long,) but wearable.  I thought Men's sizes were based on actual number measurements.  So when is 50"" not 50""?  I expect this idiocy from Women's sizing, but not from Men's.  What's the deal, Lee??

EDIT/UPDATE:  Third time was apparently the charm.  The 54/30s ordered here fit him.  I'm still curious as to why the 54/30s he bought in a brick-and-mortar store are falling-off-huge, and the Levi's 48/32s fit.  Something tells me I won't be getting any answer from Lee.","01 15, 2016",A3GQYC4DBMHOJJ,Regal Chanteuse,"{'Size:': ' 52W x 30L', 'Color:': ' Pepperstone'}",Are men's jeans online smaller than men's jeans in stores??,1452816000,True,,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry

I got 2 pair and am so glad I did!  This wardrobe staple is true to size and fits PERFECTLY all the way from just below the navel down to the top of the foot.  They're very stretchy with a higher lycra % than most cotton spandex leggings you'll find, and they're well made of a quality material that is thick enough to give terrific coverage yet light enough to stay put and remain extremely cool in all weather.  But as always, leggings are NOT trousers, so pairing them with a long tunic or a dress is recommended.  And eventhough they are not at all see-through, ""phantoming through"" will happen when you bend over at the gym, so you'll probably want to choose undergarments that provide the desired amount of coverage and are of a solid flesh-tone.  :)  They launder nicely on the gentle cycle and with tumble drying on low or cool.

I am a true US size 9, normal width, and bought a size 39 regular width after reading reviews that said to order smaller to avoid large gaps from toe to the front of the shoe. I trip a lot so I followed this advice to hopefully avoid extra tripping. I probably should've ordered the size 40 because occasionally one of my toes touches the top front of the shoe, and the width seems a bit narrow to me...but other than that they are great! I also have super flat feet so I'm still adjusting to the high arches that the shoes give me (and boy is it uncomfortable). I've been wearing them around the house for a week and they're really starting to get more comfortable after probably 10-15 hours of wear.

Duluth Trading Co. makes work shorts in a slightly heavier (""Fire Hose Canvas"") fabric, but Carhartt's are probably a better value unless the DTC ones happen to be on sale.

They're practical, too; the hammer loop and especially the low-profile side pockets are incredibly useful for carrying tools, pens, notepads, and whatnot. I find myself using them constantly.

The only downside of these heavy-duty shorts is the flip-side of their greatest virtue: the incredibly rugged fabric. It gets hot.

These shoes are really well made, the leather is very high quality plus they are cool, classic and functional. If you are getting these for soccer I would say get the long tongue (more control over the ball), if you just want these for the look the short tongue is fine. I actually have the Samba K's, kangaroo leather version at the moment and I was really upset to see that they have discontinued them. I have read that the K's are incredibly durable and the leather just molds to your foot in a unique way. I think they look as good now as they did 5 years ago. These shoes do run narrow, so I usually get a half size larger and that works for me since I have wider feet. Overall you cannot go wrong with these.

B00005LEOS,,5,"I just received my order for the Nikon 17-35mm 2.8 from Cardinal Camera, Pa that I purchased through Amazon.com...well I am very disappointed and mad as hell that Cardinal Camera of Pa sent me a USED lens that was supposed to be a brand new lens.
The Nikon box looked worn, no manual, no warranty cards, just not the usual Nikon original packing and no new lens smell plus the lens was dirty and there were witness marks on the lens barrel lock ring. This tells me that this lens was a refurb.!!!
Not 2 minutes after discovering what was delivered to me I called into Amazon.com and filed a complaint.
Over the years I have purchased 90% of my camera gear through Amazon.com and I never encountered this issue before, I also never purchased from Cardinal Camera of Pa before this event. This lens was advertised as Brand New but they thought they could porn off a used lens to me. I have been in the photography business for over 35 years...I know the difference between a new and used lens. I hope Cardinal Camera of Pa and Amazon.com resolves this issue for me as soon as possible.

Update 1/6/2014: I never received a reply from Cardinal Camera until I emailed the pres/owner, although he got back to me and apologized and said he would make it right. I was told that they could make the exchange for my new lens at one of their Pa stores but they did not have this lens in stock in any of their 13 stores and it would have to be ordered from Nikon...I found that hard to believe they wouldn't have one anywhere in their 13 stores....nothing ever became of it.... he just left me hanging. I went on line just to sample order it on their website to see if this lens would show up as back ordered or n/a...It was available at the check out screen for store pick up or delivery. So I was scammed and then lied to by Cardinal Camera....Amazon A-Z coverage saved this botched purchase and Amazon refunded me all of my money. If it weren't for Amazon A-Z purchase protection which is free, I would have had to take Cardinal Camera to court. Amazon had my credit card account refunded, this time I placed an order for the Nikon 17-35mm 2.8 from Amazon's inventory. It came UPS in 3 days with a USA warranty.

The zoom is smooth except for a tiny hitch in its linearity at 24MM.  I understand this is due to the shape of the cam in the zoom mechanism.  The positive is that the lens doesn't ""creep"" like the 24-105 F/4 IS USM.  Also - when you are at 24MM, the lens is fully extended; at 70 it is retracted.  This makes for a large lens hood, but it blocks flare effectively.

My only con is its heavy weight, but if you are shooting L glass, weight is secondary to picture quality.

B00006B9CR,,3,"Before considering this purchase I read many of the reviews. I always take readers' reviews with a grain of salt, taking into account the high praises as well as the slams. So I went ahead and ordered mine. Here's my experience:

I ordered it on Sept 27. Don't know why, but it didn't ship until Oct 1. Delivery was only two days later, though. Most of my Amazon orders are shipped and delivered much faster.

It wasn't as intuitive to set up as I had expected. Not the product's fault. I should have followed the (simple) instructions.

Orientation (calibration of cursor movement) was off, making it confusing to use. (I read where other users complained of this, too.) I was able to get it right after a few (easy) attemps using the included software utility.

Scroll wheel has a notched feel to it (movement could be smoother), so display jumps a little when scrolling. Even so, for me the scroll wheel is a nice feature to have on a trackball.

Biggest disappointment is the pressure required to press left button. Not only do you need to press it relatively hard, but also all the way in. Fortunately, the right button works perfectly.

Ball location on this unit is off-centered and to the right (unlike the original Marble mouse, where it's right there on top and centered). So that takes a bit of getting used to. Also, I happen to have large hands. If your hands are small beware... this IS a BIG unit!

I haven't played with the programmable functions yet. But I like the flexibility of having them. Also, unlike some purchasers' boxes that were listed as ""copyright 2002,"" mine is 2008. And the device itself looks a little different in that it is completely black (it doesn't have the silver trim on the top). Maybe it's a newer unit.

I'm going to give myself a few days and see if it feels better with use (i.e. left button, scroll wheel). Ball movement is smooth enough, though not quite as fluid as the wired Logitech Trackman Marble.

In summary, I like the design and potential functionality. Good effort by the maker. But I wonder how much pre-release testing went into the design. In actual use, it feels just a bit crude, especially for the price. Could use a bit more refining. But it does look cool! I think most users would probably be happier with the basic wired (and less expensive) Logitech Trackman Marble (which I also have and like). Especially when you consider that this thing, unlike a regular mouse, isn't designed to be moved around on the desk. It just sits in place, and the ball does the moving.","10 3, 2009",A1Q6ZWISKC4UOZ,L.E.S.,,Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman,1254528000,True,2,Electronics

(The Canon EW-78BII lens hood is great but contributes to the end wobble.) It is on the heavy side (mine is attached to the 20D) and after an hour or so of hand-holding it, my elbows start to twinge. On the plus side, the range is great. I love close-ups and the macro is fantastic and gets in almost as close as a similar lens on my film EOS 620 WITH a macro extender. The depth of field at the full macro is almost nonexistent, which I guess is to be expected, so the slightest variation in distance is the difference between getting it and missing it. Not easy to do handheld with a lens of this heft, so for this kind of work, a tripod and remote are essential. But, for a relatively inexpensive cost, this lens can produce some tremendous close-ups and still pull back for a nice broad landscape.

With the 8X, I spotted a fire lookout station that I'd never seen before, on a mountain 15 miles out of town. Quite remarkable. Added to that, was the research at Cornell University's Ornithology Center on the web. Birdwatchers extraordinaire; who called them a steal. I concur.

Compared to the HP 318, the DX3500 offers superior picture quality. Fine details are not lost in the 'grain' of the image. Colors are well balanced and smooth. Setup and operation are easy with the single function knob and easy to navigate menus displayed on the rear LCD.
One feature that should be mandatory on digital cameras is a lens cap or cover. This model has a lens shutter that turns off the camera when closed. In addition, there are guide lines on the viewfinder that show you where the edges of your picture will be so you don't cut off what you're trying to photograph.
Battery life is okay with alkalines although they aren't recommended for use with this camera because of the high drain. Kodak includes a Lithium Ion battery pack with this camera that provides a lot of use out of the box. Another plus is that this camera only requires two AA batteries as opposed to other units that require four.
The included software installed smoothly on Windows XP and when the camera is attached via the USB port, it shows up as a removable drive under the file manager. You can transfer files with either file manager or the Kodak software. Using the Kodak method is easier and allows you to automatically clear the camera when the pictures are downloaded.
I purchased two NiMH batteries and a charger for less than twenty dollars instead of buying the Kodak camera dock and rechargeable batteries. The dock simplifies image transfer and would be useful if you're doing a lot of picture-taking. It can also charge Kodak batteries when your camera is docked.
At medium resolution, the camera's internal memory stores 48 images. That supports 5x7 inch prints and I find this a very good amount of storage capacity in case you forget your Compact Flash card at home.
The manual is easy to read and gets the first-time digital camera user up to speed quickly. All features of the camera are covered with step-by-step instructions.
The drawbacks? They're nit-picks really.
* I'd prefer a little more heft and size to the camera to make it easier to grasp.
* The construction is not as solid-feeling as the Kodak DC series of cameras although this unit has very good fit and finish.
* Only two picture resolutions: high and medium. A low (640x480) resolution would be nice for web imaging.
* The camera does not support USB-Storage protocols. You must have the Kodak software or a compact flash card reader to transfer images to your computer.
* No provison for an AC adapter for studio use.","02 16, 2002",A1MJWOYNJSZPPJ,James,{'Style:': ' Kodak DX3500 Digital Camera'},Great entry-level digital camera,1013817600,False,,Electronics

B000051WW9,,5,"After using this CD/MP3 for over a week and reading some of the posts here regarding this player let me make some recommendations regarding using this playe, especially for people who are having problem with this player.
SUMMARIES OF THIS PLAYER PROS 1. Price it's an incredible price for what you get 2. Battery life - play at least 4-5 hours of MP3 with a pair Rechargeable Ni-MH batteries (not supplied by Memorex) 3. Read ID3 Tags and supports sub-directories 4. 45 second ESP shock protection 5. Reads CDR and CDRW 6. Acceptable sound quality 7. Read MP3 files up to 192 kbp (even though the manual says up to 128 kbp) 8. TRUE random file play
CONS 1. Awkard user interface 2. Even more awkard manual (I am ashamed of its English - Chinese is my first language too!) 3. No backlight 4. Resume doesn't work if the player powered down 5. Does not support 256 kbp files
MUST READ SECTION 1. If you are having problem with frequent clicks, skipping in the middle of playing, or skipping with MINIMUM shaking - return the player - it's defective.  That's what happened to my first player.  I returned it and get the second one which is a REVISED edition (if you flip the player over you will see a little sticker that says Suffix A which means it's a revised edition).  Skipping while shaking is all eliminated and clicks/skips while playing is greatly reduced (though not 100% gone) 2. Thoroughly test your MP3 files on your computer first to make sure they don't contain pops and clicks.  3. Make sure you DO NOT use DIRECT CD to burn your MP3 disc - this has been mentioned before many times 4. EasyCD Creator is simply NOT a good program to use to burn MP3 because EasyCD only supports ISO-9660 Level 1 format which only supports 8 characters.  Burn your disc with NERO 4.0 or NERO 5.0 which supports ISO-9660 LEVEL 2.  Basically ISO9660 level 2 format supports file name longer than 8 characters.  With ISO-9660 Level 2 my MPD8505CP displays the first 12 characters of the file name w/o any file name artifact associated with ISO-9660 level 1 + Joliet.  This is the solution to file name problems people are having. 5. Currently I have not have experience with 700MB CDR or CDRW; once I test that I will post my thoughts","12 21, 2000",A2T36YOFHCDWAC,T.

B000065BPB,,4,"****UPDATE SEPTEMBER 13 2016****

I had to come back to say that these headphones still sound amazing, maybe better than ever. I have had no sound issues despite heavy use, though I did stop using them much during the last year (I moved and forgot all about them in an unpacked bag). The one thing is that the leathery parts have deteriorated badly and they look much more beat up than they should, but after all this time of use in a tropical country I'm okay with having to replace them.

********

I am absolutely in love with these headphones. The sound is great and clear, when you crank up the volume you get louder music with no distortion, though the bass is a bit lacking (they are monitors, after all). I have tested them with everything, from Classical to Death Metal and I love the performance. I get chills with all the little things I can appreciate thanks to them (even the little snap when the singer's mouth opens... Lovely)

I travel 4 hours a day several times a week with really noisy coworkers that, quite frankly have a taste for lame music and with earbuds we waged an eternal war with sheer volume (a war I was bound to lose because of the damage I was doing to my ears). When I put these babies on the first time I got misty-eyed... I could listen to music at a moderate level and their voices... Simply vanished! The isolation works incredibly well. I can only listen to some faint comments when the music goes low or between songs, but even then the noise reduction is considerable.

I also have used them for gaming and the detail is amazing! Specially on FPS games you feel you're really inside the game. Pair these up with a game like Mirror's Edge or Call of Duty and you will get some serious thrills.

My main concerns with these headphones were size and comfort. Due to reports that they were too small I honestly wouldn't have bought them if I didn't have a friend who was willing to buy them from me if I changed my mind. I have a big head (Baseball caps fit on the last two holes) and I was very pleased with the fit I got. I don't even use them at max and they sit atop my big head with comfort. Like I said, I use them for hours with no problems, though I should mention that in hot weather the leather-like material gets rather hot.

I feel the padding may not be too durable, the ""leather"" covering feels like it could be easily pierced and a pouch would have been very, very nice to have.

I should note I spent almost a week reading reviews, talking to friends who own several pairs on this scale before I made my choice. I learned a lot and the time spent paid off.

Overall, the Senns have been great for the month I have had them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to my friends.","10 3, 2011",A1FTBU1A5H3LOS,XGibran,,Best purchase I've made,1317600000,True,2,Electronics

But the optical quality seems good, and the polarizer rotation is fairly smooth; those are the important parts, really.

I will say I wish it was packaged better: it comes in a plastic case with a thin foam sheet for padding on one side, and the case is slipped into a cardboard box.  BUT the case still doesn't ""lock"" shut that well.  Amazon's packaging was slightly sub-par (a couple pieces of that air-cell stuff in the box) for this particular order, and of the two polarizers ordered (one for me, one for a friend), one was half out of the case and risking getting scratched up in the cardboard box.  Doesn't seem to have...but a simple expedient of rubber-banding a piece of bubble wrap around it, or even just shrink-wrap atop the cardboard, should have prevented this.  Maybe my beef is more with Amazon's packaging in this case than with the actual filter product itself, so the 4-star review is just for the MRC not giving me the 'wow, water droplets roll right off' feeling he marketing mantra lead me to believe.","04 11, 2012",A3SWKQ5C1JA6KA,rtrski,{'Size:': ' 72 mm'},"Not sure how well the ""MRC"" is working",1334102400,True,,Electronics

Hook up was straight forward, but the instructions are like reading a chapter in your high school trigonometry book. DVD picture and play back qualities are trememdous! I can't give enough praise! Better than my JVC unit. I initially bought this player to kill two birds with one stone. My first generation DVD player(5yrs old) was starting to have issues, so I thought why not replace it along with my 5 disc CD carousel This would eliminate one too many components. While in itself a good idea, the capabilities of the Panasonic unit have much to be desired for CD format. First off you cannot shuffle songs at random on a fully or partially loaded tray, nor can you program specifc songs for a play list. Because the Panasonic unit plays CD's through your DVD channel, the only options for sound playback are Dolby surround, and or stereo. A CD player that plays through its Cd channel on your tuner can allow many more options, such as concert, stereo, hall, jazz, Surround simulated, etc. This of course only applies if you have a Stereo tuner with a 5.1 surround system. I also want to mention that the message window on this unit is so small you have to squint to see which track is playing. I want to love this unit, but if not for it's short commings on CD playback and options, I'm left lamenting for a better versatile unit.

The Warehouse items are supposed to be fully functional, but potentially with problems like cosmetic defects, missing box, etc. In this case, all three were defective in that they wouldn't output 120v. There is a slider switch on the back to specify the desired output voltage (110/120/127). With all 3 my multimeter showed approx 110v when set to 110, 110v when set to 120v, and 125ish volts when set to 127. I tried switching them back and forth, but there was no way to get 120v out of them. I tried them with 3 different multimeters, same results (+/- 1 volt.)  I tried daisy-chaining them to see what they would report about each other. With the first set to 120v, the second would report ""correct"" voltage if it was set to 110. Same results with any pair of units. So, the units themselves were confirming 110v output when the switch was set at 120v.

I returned all three and ordered a new unit (not warehouse.)  The new unit arrived complete with a detailed ""inspection"" printout taped to it. Initially it output 110v when set to 120. Geesh. I played around with it and found that if I moved the switch to 110, then 127, then 120, it would correctly output 120v. However, if I unplugged it, it would start up again with 110v output and I would have to go through this silly maneuver to get it to 120v.  Also, even when it was set to 120v and correctly outputing 120v, the voltage was unstable; it would bounce around between 118, 119 and 120 endlessly, even though my household voltage was constant. I thought the whole point was to make he voltage *more* stable, not *less*.

I assume that 3 people before me got defective units from Amazon, who then (erroneously) resold them to me in the Amazon Warehouse deals. Then when I ordered a new unit, I got another defective unit from the defective shipment Amazon has in stock. Or, maybe these things are all just crap.

I don't know what the problem was, but installing the FireWire card, the software and equipment was a hassle every step of the way. But, once I got over the mystyerious freezes, things have been working like a charm.
The manual that comes in the box is lacking in details.
Be forewarned, the iPod does not support .WAV files. If your files are in .WAV format, you will need to re-rip them. A friend told me that I could convert .WAV into .MP3 format but the musicmatch software doesn't do it, contrary to my friend's assertion. Maybe I'm missing something.
The ergonomics are great. The machine works flawlessly. The remote operation buttons are great.
15MB is a huge amount of storage space. I can't imagine that my music library would ever be big enough to fill the 15MB, let alone 30MB.
Get the 15MB instead of the 10MB because the 15MB comes with a docking station, remote operation buttons and carrying case. The 10MB doesn't include these items and if they are brought separately, you get close to the price of the 15MB anyway.

However, A polarizing filter is still a wise investment for any photographer. A circular polarizer cuts down on glare by being rotated. Digital filters (post-processing) can never really duplicate this effect.

The Moose Peterson filter combines the circular polarizing with a warming effect which makes it appear not so ""cold"".

I went with another online vendor that was slightly cheaper and no sales tax. Nonetheless, I wanted to make sure I provided a review on here since I had questions regarding the GS-3 and the GS-5s. I have a small 12x12 deck and I wanted to add some speakers to the outside. Since my deck is a few feet off the ground, I didn't put these speakers in the ground. Instead I went with some planters on the deck and placed these inside. Instead of the standard clay planters, I went with a plastic type (see below)

For power, I used an old 1998 JVC home receiver rated at 100w per channel. It was sitting in a closet since it doesn't have HMDI inputs and outputs. It was replaced a while back with a modern receiver. However, for outdoor entertainment, I blew the dust off of it and put it to work.

I attached a photo of my setup. I bought the planters, waterproof connections, and silicone from the big orange store. I also bought some cheap 12 gauge wire from Amazon.

The sound is good for my deck. The 360 degree sound fills my yard, deck, pool, etc. but isn't overwhelming. It distorts if I crank it very loud-but the loud volume would not be desired in my setup-so no worries there.  There is more bass than expected but is certainly isn't booming. To me it is just right because I am not a DJ on my deck-my goal of having some decent sounding music while we relax on the deck or pool. It provides enough umph to make it sound decent and not flat.

For the audio inputs, I put a few modern inputs into the old receiver. I utilized the TAPE, PHONO, and VCR inputs (lol) of the receiver. Into the RCA inputs, I hooked up a Logitech Bluetooth receiver (http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-980-000910-Bluetooth-Audio-Adapter/dp/B00IQBSW28/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1434223967&sr=1-1&keywords=logitech+bluetooth) , my ROKU (non HDMI version  http://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Media-Player-Version/dp/B00GHGMCN4/ref=sr_1_10?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1434223985&sr=1-10&keywords=roku ), and a simple AUX jack to RCA input for my old iPod. This gives me modern music from my bluetooth, Pandora from the Roku if I want to save my phone battery, and the option to use my old iPod.

Overall, I just bought it, but I'm quite happy with them. I can't say how the GS-5s sound, but my two GS-3 fit my needs.","06 13, 2015",A2H7ICQGFXDI4S,FLRoadman,"{'Size:': ' 8"" Original', 'Color:': ' Green'}",Great for my deck.,1434153600,False,9,Electronics

B00005NVPW,,3,"Apparently this camera receives lots of user compliments ... But browse it carefully you will find that a great percentage of these positive comments are from first time digital camera buyers or users. I wonder whether their opinions will hold true after they have tried other digital cameras on the market. The truth is that there are better choices out there, even at similar prices.
First let's look at a myth floating around among first time digital camera buyers:
1. Mega Pixel is everything.
Since a 3MP camera delivers a higher resolution than a 2MP camera, the picture it takes should be sharper. Sounds right? Not necessarily so. The quality of the output mainly depends on the quality of the lens and grains. A grainy 3MP photo taken with a lower quality lens is not necessarily better sharper than a low noise 2MP photo taken with a high quality lens. It happens that the photo taken with DX3900 contains lots of noise, and the 7 element in 6 group lens might not be as sharp as lens on digital cameras from other vendors in the same class.
Ok, now let's talk about the camera:
Design and built:
DX3900 is very compact. It has a slim plastic body and is suprisingly light even with two AA batteries inserted. It has a sliding door style lens cover and you can only find a few buttons on the camera. (Everything is designed for simplicity).
However, this design also brings out the issue of quality of construction. The battery door hatch and compact flash door hatch are extremely fragile. The first time I accidently dropped my DX3900 it broke the battery hatch door and the bottom of the case became cracked. Kodak initially asked $150 for fixing the battery door saying this is a flat fee. After my complaint about the high cost of fixing Kodak suddenly said somehow they calculated it wrong and I was charged $36 instead. I have to admit that their service is pretty fast though. (Two days after the phone call I got the fixed camera back.)

The LCD is only 1.5 inch and it is not bright so you might have some problem reading it under bright sunlight. However I like the LCD menu very much, it is so easy to operate even a monkey can find all the options and settings and make the adjustment.
Because I like high contrast photo and saturated color I always prefer Kodak color. The DX3900 does take photo with good color. But when I start to compare these with pictures I took with Kodak DC280 and DC290 a while ago I was hugely disappointed:The color of the photos taken with DX3900 looked very plain and dull. And then comes the worst part, the photos also have more noise than those taken with DC280 and DC290s.
DC280 and DC290 are old generation 2MP kodak digital cameras. DX3900 is a 3MP digital camera of a new generation.  But everyone who has seen my photos can tell that the 2MP photos I took with the DC280 and DC290 are better than those taken with DX3900. I don't know what Kodak has done to the DX series, they did fix the DC280 and DC290s'low shtter speed problem but they failed to produce a camera that could take better pictures than their old geneation of cameras. And the build quality of Kodak DX series is definately inferior to those ""like a brick"" feeling DC280 and DC290s. I think this is really sad.
Do I have anything to recommend with even lower price tag than the DX3900? Sure, Canon A40 and Fuji 2600Z. They are both 2MP, and I think they can compete well with DX3900.
Some suggestion for first time digital camera buyers: try and compare several digital camers before you make the final decision. What others are saying might not make sense to you. Try, compare and make decision for yourself.","07 12, 2002",A1MIXY59EXC90L,Amazon Customer,,You will think it's great if this is your first DC,1026432000,False,51,Electronics

Sleep well friends!

I subtracted 1 star for two issues that need to be addressed by the company.
1) removal of the ridiculous blue LED light - it will kill your sleep patterns until you disassemble the machine and remove it from the circuit board
2) the lack of sanitation by way of a UV-C bulb. It's possible in the engineering phase to add a UV-C bulb that would not produce ozone. This product only mechanically filters - which is nice. But it would be nicer if it included a couple technologies from the last 10+ years.

This device would be a home run if it had a UV-C bulb operating above 240nm (preferably 253.7nm) to purify (kill germs) the air in addition to cleaning it (removing particles), all without creating ozone. Sadly Honeywell was a bit cheap here. A ridiculous benefit would be an ozone generator on a 4 to 10-minute timer per 24 hour period to keep the ppm down.

Definitely looking at mid 40dB to 60dB which is a little louder than smaller room models. Wouldn't trade this one for the world though. I also have owned the Honeywell 17000s since 2008 which is probably 5-10dB quieter, but maybe only does 1/3 to 1/2 as much air.  The Honeywell 17000s I can tolerate on loud in the next room over or medium in the room I occupy. This 50250 I have to run on low or medium. High is just  too loud unless vacuuming/etc.

This 50250 filters way way way way more air than the 17000s though. It's not even close. I used the 17000s in college for a dorm room and it was great. But for a 1300sq. ft apartment with 2 bedrooms the 17000s cannot do the living room very well. This 50250 combined with the 17000s in the living room bring me back to feeling how the 17000s felt in a bedroom. I'll eventually get 2x 50250's in the living room and put the 17000s in the bedroom to hold me over until I replace the HVAC and add the parts that any decent home should've had during the building process.

I still think the blue lights on the machine are BS and I will probably disassemble at some point and remove them from the circuit board. Things need to stop coming with lights and beepers.

Additionally, I kind of wish CFM was readily listed. CADR & sq. ft are both the wrong units to measure volume and air changes (which you want 2 to 9 per hour) depending on what you're doing or how bad your asthma is. I guess companies use these measurments to seem more ""relatable"" to consumers, but it really just feels like a cover up.

The best answers on every air filter would be:
CFM, dB, filter % by micron size, filter cost, replacement interval, yearly watt usage
---> all listed by in a chart by speed setting (low, med, high).

Companies just don't want you to know if they're really the best or not. Such a shame it's left up to red boxes, bold text, and random marketing/lobbying.

*note* I did have to disassemble the 17000s after 2-3 years of running it because the motor was making bearing noise. I greased it with Pennzoil and it ran fine for 5 years then I did it again with some Amsoil nlgi #2 and haven't' had any issues since.","08 11, 2017",AR8NLMRETBVM,Mark Twain,"{'Color:': ' White', 'Style Name:': ' Air Purifier'}",Solid Filter - Will probably buy 2,1502409600,True,12,Home_and_Kitchen

The rack handles both ship's captain and duck style decanters while simultaneously accommodating 8 - 16 wine glasses.

B00004OCNU,,4,"This Oxo Good Grips whisk cannot double for the sturdy wire balloon whisk that I use for most jobs; however, it is perfect when bare metal is not a good choice for mixing.  Because I make sourdough bread and starter, I needed a non-reactive whisk to better blend the flour and water when feeding the starter.  Anything thicker than pancake batter, however, will severely test this whisk.  Its head bends quite easier, and the fit between loops is not tight enough to keep everything in place while whisking, although so far everything pops back in place when I'm done.  As with all Good Grips products, the rubber handle is comfortable and non-slip.  It also gets points for being dishwasher-safe.

Do not get this whisk if you don't already have a heavy-duty one.  This whisk is best used against nonstick surfaces or in cases where you need a non-reactive means of mixing.  For an everyday whisk, I would give it only two stars, but, as a supplemental utensil, it gets five stars from me, primarily because it is exactly what I wanted and expected.

I found I rarely use the first stage so buying the 300 with only two stages was appropriate. The new model 300 works great. The secret to a razor sharp knife is to pull the blade through at a slow controlled rate. Four passes (twice on each side) on stage two and four passes on stage three will give you  a razor sharp edge every time if your knife is in decent shape to begin with.

B00004RFMT,,4,"So, 10 years ago, I went off to college and my parents helped me stock my dorm with all of the essentials, which included a good knife set. We bought knife set, and I've used it ever since. It is a great chef knife that feels good (balanced) in the hand and can handle practically whatever I throw at it. I have always hand-washed my knife in cold water immediately after use and then placed it back in the block. (yes, I'm one of THOSE people - the type with culinary experience who goes the extra mile to keep my kitchen equipment in good shape)

About a month ago, my roommate dropped my knife and broke the tip off. #endof10yearrelationship.... with my knife.

As someone who loves being in the kitchen, this was not something I could look at every day and just deal with, so I decided to shop around and find something comparable or higher quality.
I did a ton of research, looked at a lot of comparison websites, and settled on a top choice..... Only to realize it was THE EXACT SAME KNIFE!!!!!!

So, after purchasing and receiving this chef knife, I immediately set it to work - breaking it in.

I noticed right off the bat that the BACK of the blade seemed much sharper than I was used to, and wrote it off, thinking it would be fine, and eventually it would wear down as I used it.
About 10 minutes and some irritation in my hand later, I looked at my hand to see an unreasonable amount of little slashes/cuts (like, 20 or more). They weren't deep enough to bleed, but they had definitely taken some slices out of my hand. (Which was only possible because I was holding the knife properly)
I gave the knife to my husband, who used my honing steel (a rod) to rough up the back a bit, which took the edges off. Since then, it's been almost like the whole ordeal never happened - my new knife is just the same as the old. - Looks like the beginning of another 10 year relationship ;)","03 25, 2018",A3VK5XG2S6DYCN,Rav n Hyo,{'Size:': ' 8 Inch'},Remember to roughen the back of the blade before first use!!,1521936000,True,3,Home_and_Kitchen

B000063K7G,,5,"I absolutely adore the Rabbit-style of wine opener.  It is the fastest, smoothest method of removing a cork -- and then of removing the cork from the screw.  Just the corkscrew itself is worth buying this wine tool kit.  The addition of a foil cutter, wine pourer, wine/champagne sealer, wax remover, and extra spiral elevates this kit to a comprehensive set of tools that will satisfy anyone who drinks wine.  The red color adds pizzazz to a useful set.

Not everyone will find use for all the items.  For example, the wax remover is rather esoteric, and unless you encounter a bottle with a wax seal, something that is relatively rare these days, you'll never use it.  The wine pourer is great for preventing drips, and it comes with a stopper for storing.  I have to remind myself to use that piece since I'm so used to twisting the bottle at the end of a pour.  Besides the corkscrew itself, I use the foil cutter and the wine/champagne sealer the most.  I love that the sealer twists to fit different bottle openings and that it can handle the extra pressure of sparkling wines.

The set comes in a hard, clear plastic box, making it especially beautiful for a gift.  It has found a prominent and permanent space in my wine cellar.  Note:  I received a sample for review.

B0085P68SU,,5,"After reading Helen  Scott Taylor's Unbreak My Heart, I was really looking forward to reading her next contemporary romance novel, Oceans Between Us, which I received as a gift from the author for having reviewed Unbreak My Heart.
Oceans Between Us is a beautiful story of Maria Gardener, a complete girl-next-door and Dino Rossellini, an Italian Opera singer.  The beginning of the story was very heart- breaking, as Dino's son is adopted without him being aware of it. It leaves him devastated and he moves to Porthale to find some peace and solace. That is where he comes across Crow's Nest, a warm and homely guest house that belongs to the Gardeners. Maria is so keen on taking care of Dino and making his stay as pleasant as possible. It was very touching to read how much one can care for a someone you don't even know. I don't want to get much into the storyline as I know I'll end up with tons of spoilers! So I will just stick to the tons of other amazing aspects of the book.
I absolutely loved Maria. She was so easy to relate to. Nowadays, most of the leading female protagonists are kick- ass and daring (which is awesome, no doubt), while Maria was so gentle, caring and wonderful. Her simplicity made her so much more desirable and admirable. Dino too was such a great guy. Not just his hot Italian looks, but even as a person, he was simple, down-to-earth and a real sweetheart! Both Maria's and Dino's families- who played such an important role in the story- were splendid and it was so much of fun to read about them. The relationship between Maria and her sister, Christine was so lovely, and so was the one between Dino and his mom. The Italians made such a fantastic family, and were heart- warming to read about. The few secondary characters also made the story more lively, practical and joyous! I loved that both Maria and Dino value their families and have immense respect for them.
My most favorite and treasured part of the story was when Maria and Dino are just roaming in Porthale, which is where they have their first kiss. That was absolutely remarkable!
Overall, an absolutely sweet, realistic and marvelous read, Oceans Between Us is just the perfect book. I took my own sweet time reading this one as I didn't want it to get over! I literally moved at a snail's pace, but I was so excited to move ahead that I was compelled to turn the pages...
Thank you Helen Scott Taylor for being so kind to gift a copy of your book, and for just writing this beautiful story! It is definitely worth a million bucks. :)","06 14, 2012",AKLL747CES6BJ,Sarika Patkotwar,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},A sweet and beautiful story!,1339632000,False,,Kindle_Store

B0092FVJQ8,,5,"Bryant and his younger brother Walt run the ""Smith Brothers Fight Club"" in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Walt is an Afghan vet who returned home with a prosthetic arm and leg. Bryant is a current Light Heavyweight MMA champion. Their fight club, while exclusive and by invitation only, is a community project created by the brothers that helps young promising fighters to develop their skills and get into the ""big leagues"". One difference from a typical fight club is they have an ""honor system community money chest"" - when members win big fights, they voluntarily contribute to it, when they fall on the hard times, they can take what they need; and everyone in the club has free access to it. Suddenly, the money started to disappear completely.

This is when Walt suggests Bryant hires Parker, the ""private detective next door,"" to investigate. Bryant is reluctant to bring an outsider into the club but finally agrees. Parker is an old army friend of Walt's who saved his life in Afghanistan; capable, tall, good looking, and unmistakably female. The moment Bryant and Parker met is when the real story begins...

This is primarily a romance story, on the background of a very competitive sport, Mixed Martial Arts, and with a dose of mystery that keeps things more interesting. The romance part is finally crafted - while the attraction of the main protagonists is almost immediate, they have to fight through the obstacles, their pasts playing a large part, to be together. However, just like in most of Charity Parkerson's books, it is much more than a simple romance. Family ties and camaraderie; strong, noble, broken and yet very human characters make the storyline move forward with the smoothness that makes this book a very enjoyable reading.

You'll like some characters and dislike the others; you will also change your opinion about some of them as you keep reading. There are surprises here and, ""spoiler,"" a happy end. If you are looking forward to reading a ""feel good"" romantic story that is rich in plot and character development, this book is it.

B008S1VH5K,,3,"C.R.O.W. is the first book in a military scifi series that's barely scifi, but certainly a lot of military, where it followed the travails of this new recruit Moralee, derisively called CROW (combat replacement of wounded) by the unit as the unit deploys for war on New Earth. Apparently the whole ""old"" earth only deploys British soldiers now, as the only other ethnicity mentioned was the hostile Chinese forces currently in control of New Earth.  During the voyage the noob was hazed by sadistic senior troopers and barely tolerated by the sergeants, and the battlefield tends to quickly make a man out of boy, or kill him outright...

The problem with this book is while the book is certain military, and all the training and barrack life sound authentic, the scifi elements are horrible. Much of the fighting seem to be barely advanced from present day. Assault rifles are now miniature rapid-fire railguns (with no external power source?) and one still do bayonet and grenade charges. Fire teams carry Smart launchers (can be deployed in sentry mode: automatically launch against designated threats, land or air) and fire team leaders carry smart grenade launchers (ability to home-in on designated targets). Air support is provided by gatling gun armed drones... As I said, not too far ahead out present day, despite FTL travel and full body NBC armor suit.

The prose style, being British, also takes a bit of getting used to. Seems these Brits don't swear, despite being soldiers.

Frankly, scifi combat had been done better, much better before. David Drake's Slammerverse, StarFIST series, Lucky 13th Spaceborne series... all managed to provide plenty of combat. There are even lesser known series that may be even better.

The enemies are faceless and could have been anybody. The combat could have been present day or even 20 years ago.

All in all, if you want a British perspective on military and (sorta) scifi, give this a try.","11 15, 2015",A2S5EPJ451WL3I,Guy Reviews Romance and More,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},"British take on military scifi is all military, very little scifi, and not that much combat till the end",1447545600,True,3,Kindle_Store
B005ME39HU,,5,"This is a winter cozy for sure! Before I was even halfway through with this book, I bought the next one in the series! I thoroughly loved this book. I laughed and teared up here and there. But I mainly laughed. This was a comical romance, Chirstmisy, cozy book. And NO the romance was not too mushy like mashed potatoes!

I loved how the author had no foul or crude language in the book at all! So if children wish to read this, do it. And there is absolutely no sex in it and there are no steamy scenes. Sorry if you are a big fan of that. I enjoyed this book to the max.

Lexi is a single mother of two children with a TV show. She is the new Martha Stuart of the times. Her children and her love reading this series by Kyle Miller. And her children especially want to meet him and will get to for they have recently moved to the town the author resides in. But Lexi meets Kyle in an unpleasant way, he is destroying her snow man. I will not reveal anymore but it becomes very funny after that scene.

This is a great book for mothers and daughters or for the whole family to read together. It will make you cry a little in places but more than anything it will make you LAUGH. And it is set in the time frame of a couple of days before Christmas and then, of course, Christmas Day! And as I have stated there is No language in the book. The romance isn't so steamy it fogs up your Kindle screen and there are no step by step sex scenes.

B004YWKEKQ,,2,"As much as I hate to call any book boring, sometimes, that's just what it is.  You have a hero (Hawksley) who is returning to society after the death of his father and brother and a heroine (Poppy) who has had three seasons and still has not found the love of her life.  Poppy convinces her brother to allow her to invite females to his house party.  Poppy plans to use this as an opportunity for matchmaking with her friends.
The tension between Poppy and Hawksley is excellent.  Their attraction and love match is genuine.  The problem, however, is that this story goes nowhere.  Other than the interaction with the girls' school, all the characters do is participate in a house part of several weeks.
There is another love match that occurs between two people who love each other, but due to a misunderstanding have not done a good job of conveying their feelings.  This party provides the perfect venue to set things straight.  To be honest, this side story was one of the better components.
The rest of the story just plods along.  The author provides the HEA, but the ending at Hawksley's home is a bit forced.  Perhaps the marriage should have occurred earlier and more time spent at the hero's estate would have helped the story a bit.
In conclusion, I say pass on this one.  Any redeeming quality it may have had is mitigated by the lack of editing.  The more the story progressed, the more egregious the errors.","06 28, 2012",AHAVDM445MD1W,Never without a book,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Boring,1340841600,True,8,Kindle_Store

Much more realistic than the fantasized werewolf books where all of the participants are so beautiful, both men and women, perfect and sickeningly careful not to hurt anyone unless they plan it.

Trauma surgeon, Kim has just lost the partnership career he sought. However, rescheduled accommodations and seasickness has Kim thinking this impulsive escape to diagram a new future is a terrible idea until he discovers that his roommate is the sexy dive master Shane McCormack.  The close quarters on the ship and the mutual attraction, is the perfect setting for a vacation fling.

No Souvenirs is the story of Jae Sun Kim whom we first met in Collision Course.  What started out as a vacation fling for Kim and Shane evolves into a romance after an unforeseen dramatic experience leaves them emotionally altered.  When Kim returns home to Jacksonville, Florida, Shane follows him to explore the possibility of a relationship.  The characters are well developed.  Both men have a high degree of intelligence.  Kim employs logic as well as arrogance when dealing with people, being inexperienced with relationships.  His lack of skill in expressing his emotions is a source of annoyance for Shane.  Easily bored and hiding behind a dumb cowboy personality, Shane avoids situations that will require dedication from him until he realizes that a life with Kim is what he wants.  The secondary characters add another layer of interest to the overall plot.  Interaction between Kim and Shane is sarcastic, humorous and incredibly erotic.  The amazing K. A. Mitchell has produced another exciting saga that I thoroughly enjoyed.","04 12, 2010",A3TZ6HA75W08O4,Ro,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},BETTER THAN A SOUVENIR,1271030400,False,8,Kindle_Store

Leave Me Breathless is my favorite novel in the Ross Siblings companion series to date.

+++ First, if you're bored by intense description, you'd give this book only one or two stars, but I couldn't peg you as a real reader. The descriptions are delicious, and necessary; they're the stage, the environment, where the story unfolds.
+++ Second, yes, the ending is clear from early on, but getting there is all the fun!
+++ Third, what one reviewer calls ""Hinduism"" is actually Buddhism plus some 1915 New Age thinking.

This book struck a particular chord for me because of its eastern European flavor. When the Samavians cry and shout before their leader, and stand stone-faced at the formal ceremonies, I felt it, saw it. Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, I stood with masses of Hungarians of all ages in Parliament Square, Budapest, waiting to hear their newly elected president speak. Every young person stood rock-still; every person old enough to remember the violent Hungarian uprising of 1956 or the Prague Spring of 1968 was crying. Reading this fictional story of Samavia's liberation from decades - centuries - of bloody repression, I recalled the solemn remembrances of the Hungarians in that Square, and the elation of those at the first ""alternative"" May Day parade, when the Russian tanks did NOT move in to break up the demonstration.

Perhaps most readers will not have had such experiences, but the tale may resonate nonetheless with any reader who values faith, hope, kindness, discipline, and courage.","06 8, 2015",A3M41F4SQ2PDIV,doctormama,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Not just for boys!,1433721600,True,10,Kindle_Store

The writers take you on a roller coaster of a ride that had me LITERALLY sitting on the edge of my seat and at times yelling, crying, laughing out loud, or a combination of all three! They weave a story with such imagination and characters that you really come to care about.

And as promised, questions are answered by the end of episode 18. Including the huge question of what happened on October 15 and why. And be sure to read Sean's message at the end of episode 18. Because it will make fans very happy ---- the readers can look forward to 3 more seasons of Yesterday's Gone! The only down side is that we have to wait a year to get season 4. Ugh!

B004ZR9FSW,,3,"Reviewing the Kindle version.

I enjoyed this short story for what it was, a cute tale about an introverted fast-food manager who finds short-term love with an alien girlfriend.  The premise was interesting and the characters were appealing.  But- I felt the story needed more development.  It left a lot of unanswered questions but no sense of mystery to go with them, and no sense of hope, either.

I read three short stories by Carroll this week and they all left me feeling that the author didn't really let the reader into the character's head, and that there was a lack of destination, a sense that the stories should have gone someplace farther but didn't, that we should have had a better understanding of what was going on in the character's mind, and they were rather bleak in outlook.  I do think that Carrol has some very creative and interesting ideas and look forward to seeing more of his stories.","06 3, 2011",A3M1OXDYS1N9SY,Athene Five,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Nice story about Alien Love,1307059200,True,,Kindle_Store

Genesis aka Gee can be some what annoying. She a brat, know it all, thinks she is some kind of bad ass, and basically kinda of a bitch. Her great magical power is that she can see into the future. In book two she becomes a Demon hunter and let's see she still gets her ass beat . They train her to fight against demons when she herself is just a human ...this part of the store is a bit crappy at least give some super power or something semi believable. Despite that she comes off cocky. And a bad ass( yea I know I repeated it again cause she was that annoying).  Which is dumb because she isn't the is always making  good choices and is a know it all wannabe bad ass. The is the theme of the book. Then there is Seth ...can you say whipped much and puppy dog carter just jumps back on that train. They are both ok, but they are so wrapped up in Gee to me it makes them a bit unlikable....idk what book those other people read but I found it a waste of time and money.

Then the first big battle against impossible odds, and the heroine won very implausibly. OK, so on to the next really big battle in the Southern desert against even worse odds. Spoiler alert, she found new magic and saved the day and the really bad evil wizard gave up and disappeared for no apparent reason. The book should have ended there.

The first 80% of the book up to the end of the last big battle is OK to excellent although the battles are too implausible and similar. The last 20% is maudlin, grinding, emotional repetition telling how everyone feels repetitively. It must have been written by another author, because the writing quality, and lack of editing, just was not in keeping with the higher quality of the first 80% of the book. I kept reading to the very end fully expecting something important to happen or at least something to set up a cliff hanger to get me to read the next in the series, and, spoiler alert again, nothing happened.

B005YCQM9C,,3,"I was at first captured with the plot but unfortunately it began to fizzle out too soon.  The story began with the  intensity with which Rebecca and Genevieve, the main characters in this story, came together.  I was impressed how the author made Genevieve bold and strong.  She saw Rebecca and with one look into her eyes knew what she wanted.  She didn't question whether it was appropriate or not.  It was, after all ""love at first sight""!

They were together for four years and remained very much in love until one day tragedy struck.  I will explain my problem with the story -- when two people love each other and have been together as long as Rebecca and Genevieve had, it was unexpected that Rebecca would just fold like a house of cards at the first test to their commitment and journey through life together.  I realize this is the author's prerogative to make her characters any which way she wants but give us readers a little credit.  Stories need to have credibility, substance and character.  I read this story because I had just finished reading ""Guilty Hearts"".  I reviewed that book and saw ""143"" and  based on the five star reviews, I decided to read it.  I believe Ms. Winters has all the elements of a great writer.  She obviously gives her characters substance and makes them endeared to her reader until the middle of the story and then Ms. Winters switches her style and makes it appear as though she has become bored with her creation and just rushes to the finish.  I have mentioned this rush to end a story on my prior reviews of this author's work and I irritate again, give us, the reader, a little better glimpse into the main characters connection from beginning to end.","01 17, 2014",A3RZTU9LZEZL33,Violet,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Good Plot!,1389916800,True,,Kindle_Store

B006LQYG48,,5,"The Kissing Tree is a delightfully sweet historical romance. Although a year is not given, it takes place in early American history. Colorado has been settled. Small towns have been established around farming and cattle ranch communities. Crystal Creek is just such a small town.
When the story begins thirteen year old protagonist Georgiana McLaughlin has recently lost her father to a tragic horse accident. She and her siblings, along with their mother are traveling to New York to stay with Aunt Cecelia for the summer break. Before they leave, she steals a kiss from Ridge Carson under the kissing tree and runs. She doesn't return home until five years later.
Georgiana returns to Colorado, leaving behind a young man waiting for her to accept a marriage proposal.  He is a charming man, who adores her, but she can't bring herself to say yes. When she arrives home she finds Ridge all grown up and working on her grandfather's cattle ranch.
The chemistry Bice creates between Georgiana and Ridge is delightful. Georgiana is all Irish fire and spunk. The way in which these to spar will have you giggling. There is wholesomeness to this tale that I find refreshing.
The Kissing Tree has a love triangle, villains and finds our heroine in danger. The tale unfolds at a wonderful pace. Bice writes a story with lots of twists, and wraps it all up in a bow at the end. She delivers the perfect romantic story that will leave you feeling good.
I am adding Prudence Bice to my list of authors to watch.  The Kissing Tree will be available on December 6, 2011. This would make the perfect gift for the romance reader on your holiday shopping list.

B005UPRR6A,,4,"Wish there was more of a story to it, but this was really good -
There was nothing primal about this threesome -

Cait and her fianc Nathan were talking about a book Cait was reading - about a threesome.
He told her that if she wanted to fulfill her fantasy and have one, he would be ok with it.

Their closest friend Liam was coming into town for the weekend from overseas, and Cait knew that he would be the one Nathan felt safe enough to do this with.

But Cait had her doubts. She felt the desire to give in, but the embarrassment and nervousness about Nathan saying he's more secure in their relationship than he was letting on.
She was afraid she would like it too much.

When Liam came into town, her body jumped at each flirtation remark or movement that was considered normal for them, but after spending so much time thinking about other things he could do to her , she had to get out of there!

Leaving for work as soon as he showed up only stalled her feelings for a little while. Things got so intense for her from just sitting on the couch watching TV in-between these two, even the attentive strokes on her neck from Nathan that were meant to calm her down did just the opposite.

The next day was Liam's last day visiting them. after watching Cait's reactions, he knew she wanted this, but was too afraid to admit it. After Dinner when Liam went upstairs to shower was the perfect time to get Cait to relax. Although she was still closed off to having Liam join them, she was extremely aroused enough that the idea was starting to wear her down.

After a few attentive strokes and sensual kisses, Liam walked into the kitchen and watched as Nathan aroused his fianc.
When Cait saw Liam, she was just about to push away from Nathan and refuse, but he held her in place. Talking smoothing words in her ear. Liam started walking towards her. ...

The tenderness these two men showed Cait was surreal - I loved the way they looked out for her, watched her ever reaction and were prepared to stop at any given moment -

B005L35E3O,,4,"I don't generally read Science Fiction, but the beginning of this novella grabbed me. Viktor was having a rough start with his first Peacetalker mission trying to negotiate peace with the Lyrissian delegation aboard the Callisto. Peacetalker Tarn took offense when Viktor miscommunicated while trying to speak in the Lyrissian's own language. Luckily, S'rea, Tarn's daughter, was able to speak common so the Alliance of Worlds peace talks could move forward.

Viktor is confronted with several cultural differences as he learns more about the Lyrissian as the talks proceed. There are several humorous miscommunications between S'rea and Viktor dealing with mating rituals of the Lyrissian. S'rea has no intention to ever take a mate, she is a scientist and loves her profession. Viktor is recently divorced and has no intention of having any relationships right now.

Karo was the other Peacetalker dispatched by the Lyrissian to negotiate peace with the Orka in a neighboring galaxy. Karo has an agenda of his own which includes taking S'rea as a mate whether she agrees or not. The Orka are an aggressive and violent race who mutate their females into hideous monsters to use as warriors. They are a humanitarian nightmare.

This is an enjoyable story that moves at a nice pace. The reader will find humor, political intrigue, violent confrontations, and romance. I found it easy to become invested in the outcome from the humans on the Starship Callisto to the Lyrissian race as a whole. They had a fascinating hierarchy and culture.

The only thing I had a problem with was that S'rea was referred to as the eldest daughter of Tarn in the beginning of the story. However, at the end Ae'a is the eldest daughter.

B0054TYTYA,,5,"I was very happy to see a Yahtzee game for Kindle. I have always enjoyed playing it. The game controls are easy to learn. I like the fact that there are different modes you can play. There is the ""classic"" game that everyone is familiar with. There is ""quick play"" which you play by yourself - great to see how high a score you can achieve. There is ""duplicate"" mode where both you and the kindle player use the same dice. You go first, take your turn, take your score. When kindle plays you'll see that kindle's rolls are the same as yours - but will kindle decide to score the same way as you or not?? There is also a ""Battle"" mode. In that game, each player starts out with 100 points. The object is to take away your opponent's points before yours are taken away. When you roll the dice and take your score, if you score in the ""lower"" section ( large straight, small straight, full house etc.) the amount of points is taken away from your opponent. If you score in the ""upper"" section ( 1's, 4's, 6's, etc.) you gain points. By pressing the ""S"" key you can see the scoresheet. I have played all of the modes and like them all. I think Electronic Arts did a fine job with the game.","06 29, 2011",AAYI6623I97XO,Candace Kiekhefer,,yahtzee lover,1309305600,True,95,Kindle_Store

B0076EHRZ4,,3,"Raith Malloy has better things to do then fantasize about the gorgeous attorney Willow DeVane. Except he can't seem to do anything but that exactly. She gets under his skin with every word she shoots his way but he can't seem to leave her alone. Knowing she is out there unprotected grates at him until him finally finds himself in the arms of the sexy attorney.
Willow is a tough divorce attorney but that doesn't mean she isn't a lush woman too. When she is attacked she doesn't want to accept Raith's help but feels she needs to call his bluff on offering to teach her self defense. What she doesn't realize is that while there is a stalker on the loose, she really needs to be protecting her heart from the grumpy cop.

I really liked the premise of this book however I found it to be riddled with things that rubbed me the wrong way. First off Raith. I love take charge alpha guys but I never got past how completely mean and awful Raith is to Willow throughout the entire book. I have never seen two more prickly characters. They constantly are fighting. Constantly giving each other snide comments and hurting each others feelings. Over-thinking everything imaginable and working on assumptions about every person they see the other with. I think they went way past the banter and straight into annoying territory. I spent a lot of my time shaking my head at their conversations. Raith is condescending about everything to Willow. Yes, she deserved a lot of it with her immature behavior but wow...I think if a guy talked to me like Raith talked to Willow, first I'd knock his head off and then I'd kick him out of my house. I don't care how good the sex is. But she takes it. Raith is like some kind of sick drug to her. She doesn't like him, they fight, and yet she keeps taking it because the sex is great.
From the blurb the book sounds like a romantic suspense however I didn't see it as such. Willow is attacked in the courthouse at the very beginning and yet that has nothing to do with the actual plot. Its convenient yes, but you never hear or see the guy responsible after that incident. Instead we get two minor altercations through out the book before something big happens. In between this is completely a contemporary romance. The threat seems to pop up when its needed but if it were a sustained threat it would have worked much better with the genre. There needed to be more happening to Willow on the stalker front then the feeble tricks that we got.
The level of writing was pretty good but I wouldn't say it was on the level that a lot of romantic suspense authors at your local bookstore are at. Some of the conversations felt jilted and incomplete. The characters didn't feel rounded and so they came off to me as one dimensional. There were a few spots in the book that I really enjoyed but they seemed to be few and far between . While I wanted to like this one much more then I did, my problems connecting with the characters left me wanting more from the book then what I was given.

There are interviews with stunt men, actors and actresses, and directors.

Some of the most touching stories come from actress Viola Dana and stuntman Harvey Parry. Parry says, ""It was just a different day... I wish I could really explain... the greatness of the old days."" This collection does a great job at explaining.

0783116926,,5,"Long before scary movies involved blood and gore, George C Scott starred in this horror film that is very spooky, indeed! Scott plays a composer who, having just lost his wife and daughter, moves into a very atmospheric old house in New England to get some serious writing done. Shortly after moving in, Scott is contacted by the spirit of a young boy who died in the house. But what is it the boy is trying to tell him?
There are scenes in this film that never cease to make my hair stand on end, no matter how many times I have seen the film (and that's alot of times...). The scene with the ball which belonged to Scott's daughter which won't go away, the chair at the top of the stairs, the ghostly voice superimposed on the tape recording of the seance, the chase through the attic... my skin crawls even now.
One can empathise with the rage of the spirit of a child, crippled and confined to a wheelchair in life, and his desperation and frustration when he tries repeatedly to convey a message which Scott, though all ears, continues to fail in understanding. Oh, and the film is supposedly based on true events.... hopefully dramatised for effect.
While the ending is not anywhere near as gripping in conclusion as the road to it, the film is certainly one you do not want to watch alone at night in a very big, spooky house.","07 23, 2002",A1SW80RQNB3DMK,EquesNiger,{'Format:': ' DVD'},One of the Best Ghost Story Films made to date!,1027382400,True,9,Movies_and_TV

If the producers really wanted to spread the work and improve people's lives and the world, then they should have more variety in the video. Yes I know you can argue that only the privileged white people will buy this, but that is not what the material is aimed at - it appears, anyway.

0792842111,,5,"This is one of my favorite films. Jonathan Demme did a brilliant job with this film. He tied all the elements of a good script and made it into a great film.  The acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is outstanding and they were perfectly cast. This is not your typical horror movie but a mix of pyschological terror and drama.  Jodie Foster plays the role of a young and determined Clarice Sterling  who is training to be an FBI agent.  Her boss gets her interested in a case which seems might fit her persona and may help her in the long run.  The case involves a psychopath they call Buffallo Bill (played by Ted Levine) who skins large woman. She takes the case and this is where we first get introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lector ( Anthony Hopkins) a renowned psychiatrist who went mad.  He is locked up in a maximum prison facilty in Maryland for the criminally insane.  Buffalo Bill was one of his patients and Clarice needs to slowly unravale the mystery behind the skinings, why they are happening, and help provide the FBI with a psycological profile of the killer. In order for her to do so she needs Dr. Lectors help.

Hannibal agrees to help but in the process he ""toys"" with  Clarices feelings and brings back her tortured past when she was a little girl. In order for Clarice to capture Buffalo Bill she must eventually confide in him, which she does.  Clarice tells Hannibal what happened to her  when she was young and how it effected her. Hannibal slowly gives out more clues about the killer. Clarice takes the information and investigates each of them thoroughly. You can tell how dedicated she is from this case from the beginning of the movie and throughout. I like how they made her female character so strong. Soon Clarice finds herself in a race against time because the killer has struck again and kidnapped a senators daughter.  Clarice asks Dr. Lector for the identification of this pyscopath in order to save the young girls life. In exchange for this information we are lead to believe that Dr. Lector will be transferred to a less maximum security prison where he can be more ""free"". This is when the movie gets really intense. Clarice is brilliant by putting the pieces of the puzzle slowly together. I don't want to give too much away. This is not for the weakhearted as there are some very gory scenes and intense images regarding what the serial killer actually does. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won an oscar for this highy acclaimed movie in 1991 for Best Actor and Best Actress. Jonathen Demme also won for best director and the movie won best picture. I also recommend the book by Thomas Harris because it is as good as the movie. This DVD also offers 20 minutes of deleted scenes that never made it into the theatrical version and it has over an hours' worth of footage on how the movie was made. The moving making also includes interesting interviews by Jodi Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Ted Levine and many other people who were directly involved in this project a must see. They also reveal how certain props were used for scenes in the movie and how they had to do some research on how to make the movie shots look more realisitic.  This DVD has a photo gallery of scenes that were made during the movie altough they are mostly outtakes when the camera wasn't rolling.

Like all Jane Austen adaptations, this is a period piece usually with a great deal to say about society and love. Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson are both more than appealing in their roles as the main characters. Winslet is the hopeless romantic, always getting her heart stolen and broken and coming ever so near the heroine's last breath, while her sister, played flawlessly by Thompson, is the older, more mature and settled one who tries her best to keep Winslet grounded. The book is full, like other Austen books, of misunderstandings and missed opportunities for love, and Ang Lee brings a beautiful sensitivity to the nuances of these relationships, which, in less capable hands, could come across in a crass and altogether unappealing fashion.

 The Carousel title is inclusive of the American version of the movie, from the 1950s, plus Liliom, the French language, English subtitled, 1934, B&W version, upon which the American version of Carousel was based. Prior to seeing this, we were not aware of the 1934 video.
 The State Fair title includes the 1945 version, with Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, Vivian Blaine and Jeanne Crain in the lead roles, as well as the 1962 version, with Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Pamela Tiffen and Ann Margaret in the lead roles. Those familiar with the title will remember that there was an earlier, B&W version, from around 1933, with Will Rogers, as the family patriarch but I don't recall the other players. That 1933 version was not included in this DVD set. While the 1933 and 1945 versions retained the venue of State Fair in Iowa, the 1962 version chose to change the venue, to Texas, for no discernable reason. Each of the three versions has its strengths and weaknesses and each kept to the basic plan of the story but with wide variations, in the details and side issues.
 The South Pacific DVDs includes the Broadway version, at 157 minutes in length, as well as the road show version, which ran for 172 minutes.
 The first of the two Sound of Music DVDs contains the video, while the 2nd DVD contains a special introduction, by Julie Andrews, as well as additional background info, about the show, the characters, the von Trapp family and, for some reason, a Mia Farrow screen test.

078060718X,,5,"This is one of my all time favorite films.

One of the film's novel twists is that it criticizes the beliefs of fundamentalists not by questioning their God's existence, but by asking whether their God's actions are fair.

The first 3/4 of the film follows a fairly typical religionist's  ""I was lost but now I'm found""  story line.

  The last part skillfully portrays the film's heroine coming to terms with the growing realization that her God's actions (or inaction in some instances) do not appear to be justified.
  The movie does this by placing her in situations somewhat reminiscent of the Biblical stories of Job and also Abraham & Isaac.

After a while it seems that God has abandoned her; or perhaps God is simply 'testing' her, and He is waiting for her to commit an act which involves a huge leap-of-faith.
She (as a good fundamentalist) chooses to believe the latter with bitter and tragic consequences.

Late in the film she meets another devout Christian who tells her that God is great because He forgives us for our sins,
her response is: ""Who forgives God?"".","12 26, 2006",A2WH490LOPQSAA,P. Neeley,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Is the God of Christian fundamentalists fair?,1167091200,False,5,Movies_and_TV
0792844718,,4,"There's a reason why Michael Keaton is one of my favorite comedic actors: he's simply so good. Keaton plays an out of work dad who has to take over the household duties while his wife brings home the bacon. The subplots have Keaton's wife, Teri Garr, being pursued by her boss and Keaton being pursued by a woman in the neighborhood.

The funniest part is when Keaton is dreaming his wife has caught him with another woman and has shot him.

It is superb story unfolding details of a murder of a wife by her husband in parallel with unfolding of a romantic and passionate relationship of another budding couple. Yes, James Stewart looks too old to be a bachelor photographer but that could not rob him and the screen of his charming personality. Stewart and Kelly looks at the different tenants of the apartment complex and finds in them one of the possibility of their own relationship - boy leaves girl alone, boy without a lady, married couple but with little match, happily married or at the bottom of a relationship so as to kill the wife. Stewart/Kelly pursues the worst combination but comes out - expectantly - as the best one. These two opposite threads run throughout the film to finish with a very subtle and beautiful ending, marking Hitchcock's mastery of story telling. One of my all time favorite.","01 29, 2010",A2BS9YVLPGQZ3I,Gautam De,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Oscar Grade Romantic Thriller,1264723200,False,2,Movies_and_TV
0792160932,,5,"Volume 11 of Star Trek contains two classic sci-fi episodes that have both well developed and entertaining plots.  This pair of episodes truly bring out the greatness of the Star Trek Original Series.  Whether it's quirky comical moments in TOMORROW IS YESTERDAY or all out bizarre humanoid behaviour in RETURN OF THE ARCHONS, Volume 11 is sci-fi at it's best.
The first episode here TOMORROW IS YESTERDAY is a personal favourite of mine.  This was one of the first Trek episodes to deal with time travel.  The Enterprise goes into a black hole that takes them back to the late 1960's.  There the crew confronts a US Fighter Pilot and is forced to beam the man aboard after his jet is destroyed by the ship's tractor beam.  The pilot's name is Cpt. Christopher (played by Roger Perry) and Kirk realizes that he cannot return the young Captain to Earth because it may alter the course of time with his knowing of the Enterprise however Cpt. Christopher refuses to stay and tries to escape this leads to more problems on the Enterprise.  The whole time travel plot was fairly good and the man on the moon thing was quite accurate to the timew period: the late 1960's.  Comical moments include Kirk run in with the flirtatious computer as well as the Sgt.'s tour aboard the Enterprise(you'll know what i mean if you have seen the episode).  This truly is a classic!
The other episode here is THE RETURN OF THE ARCHONS.  Kirk and the crew visit a planet ruled by Landru a so called god who controls the minds of his people and punishs those who are not of the body.  The episode has a bizarre yet interesting and enterating plot about mind controlling.  It is so strange when Landru reveals what he actually is but not suprising when you see the way his minions act under his control.  Another classic Trek episode
but I prefer TOMMOROW IS YESTERDAY over this just slightly more.
Overall Volume 11 is a must.  Both Trek episodes have great science fiction elements that make these episodes special.  Truly some of the greater Trek adventures.

The cut of the ""Willow Song"" was bad judgment, perhaps, but I found the flashbacks regarding his childhood and the ballet interesting and well done.  Zeffirelli always has the courage to be innovative and tries to bring some new vision to his productions.  I have all the filmed versions that are available and have this one on VHS and LD, therefore, have shared it with many friends and those new to opera.  Everyone just loved it without having a staged production to compare it to.  The staged production from Covent Garden, Solti and Te Kanawa is wonderful and highly recommended (5+ stars).  However, I liked the excellent performances in this movie, the settings and photograpy if not Domingo's makeup and teeth, which I can live with.  Katia, Placido and Justino were a great cast and did a very good job of acting and singing.  I feel it is a credible MOVIE version of this, which required dubbing.  It is one of my all time FAVORITE operas, (I've seen Placido perform live 25 times between LA and NY with various other cast members).  The best version is one from The Met with Placido, Fleming and Morris but not available commercially.  Write to The Met and request they release it for production on DVD - then the best would be available.  Placido wasn't totally pleased with this film either and it was shot at a sad time in his life as well, having just lost his beloved father.  I recommend this as a really good buy if you like opera movie videos.  It sure beats anything Hollywood has churned out in the last 10 years!  Thanks to Amazon for making all these opera videos available!  We Opera Buffs can never get enough of the sport and need videos to keep us going in between live performances!

6301965663,,5,"Janie Barlow (Joan Crawford) is a dancer; she'll do anything to dance, including dance in a strip show. She's quite a beautiful girl, and despite her low standards, she draws the attention of a wealthy playboy Tod Newton (Franchot Tone). He uses his monetary influence to get her a small part in a big show, directed by Patch Gallagher (Clark Gable). He takes a shine to her, but hides it by being mean to her. She's torn between Tod and her career, which seems to be flourishing in front of her very eyes.

I've always loved Joan Crawford, especially the gorgeous Joan of the early '30s, so this movie is an absolute delight for me. It helps that two wonderful actors join her: hubby Franchot Tone and lover Clark Gable. They're flanked by some major stars making early film appearances: the Three Stooges, Fred Astaire, and Nelson Eddy. Not bad for an early musical. This one is pretty innovative too with all of the moving camera shots and Busby Berkeley-like dancing sequences. This film is completely saccharine and not the kind of film you learn something from, but it is completely entertaining and a joy to watch.

Also included on this DVD are two musical shorts featuring one or more of the Three Stooges. Plane Nuts stars Ted Healy and his Stooges in a cute short with the group in their very early stage. Each stooge is very funny in his own right, but it is interesting to see how differently they behaved when they first began. This short features popular music of the era. Roast Beef and Movies is a technicolor short featuring Curly Howard.","11 30, 2007",A37S3ACL57LN62,Samantha Glasser,{'Format:': ' DVD'},"""Occupation: Hipswinging!""",1196380800,False,4,Movies_and_TV

6301826558,,5,"Intolerance is one of those rare films that stretched the boundaries of  the medium of film. It is  a sweeping epic that contains four stories  each tragic each highlighting the intolerance man has for his brothers  through out the ages. Although a long movie (3hours) we find ourselves totally immersed in it and mesmerized by it. It is not just a movie but an experience.

Its themes  are as relevant today as they were then as among other topics it tackles  it shows how  people  mistrust each other  because of  superficial things such as difference in race and in religion and how we carelessly blunder into war. And in the end how the character flaws of just one individual can bring the collapse of an entire civilization.

The sets  of the movie  were massive and unheard of in their day. When the movie was made it was made on a closed set and much secrecy surrounded the project but people could not ignore the set of Babylon as it began to rise  over  Los Angeles.

The film is not perfect as some of the performances in the epic vary in quality the sets and story lines astound and it still stands as one of the most ambitious movies ever made and sets the bar  for the film epic.

A handful of separate stories are joined by the repeating image of Lillian Gish rocking a cradle. It is a symbol of nurturing a mother and the hope that comes with each new generation. It is a symbol of the passage of time with the endless parade of carnage through out history contrasted with the fact that we all come into the world in the same way. It is a very moving and powerful image.

The story of the intolerance of man is told through a handful of stories - the fall of Babylon, the crucifixion of  Jesus, the persecution of the Huegenots and the (then) present day meddling of well meaning  social workers.

Although Griffith hammers away at the theme of intolerance and its destructive consequences the last story to conclude involves a man falsely convicted, and is now about to be executed and whose life literally hangs by a thread (or rather several, though an apparatus where a group of men  each cut away at a string  not knowing which one will trip the door to the gallows) and is at the last minute (after  a frantic car race to the warden) spared. In this way Griffith offers the viewer a glimmer of hope that the cycle of intolerance will someday be broken.

One wonders if the subject matter and title has something to do with the reaction D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation "" received. This  movie plainly  shows  Griffith's  stance on the evils of racism.

 One cannot help but think that the movie is making a political statement as well as during the time of the movie's release  W.W. I was raging in Europe.

A great spectacle as well as a thoughtful meditation.

In my book it is one of the top fifty films of all time.

6300182800,,4,"One does not usually expect to find quality acting in a movie like this, but I was quite surprised.
David Carradine plays a policeman on the trail of two cases that seem linked.  The first involves a window washer who suddenly loses his head.  Later there are more rooftop disappearances, seemingly perpetrated by a giant bird.  The second case involved a series of ritualistic murders.  They seem to be the work of a fanatic following Aztec rituals to bring back the god Quetzalcoatl.
Carradine's portrayal is excellent but he cannot hold a candle to Michael Moriarty who plays a down-on-his-luck loser.  He wants to be a jazz pianist but is still unemployed.  He is also a timid small-time crook.  He is a driver (""I don't go inside and I don't carry a piece!"").  But a job goes wrong and he finds himself on the run.
Moriarty hides in the Chrysler building and discovers that the run-down art-deco spire is the home of the giant bird.  There is even an egg in the nest.  A body hidden there gets him thinking.  The city is in fear of the bird and he knows where it is.  He is convinced he is now the most important man in the city.
Now that he thinks he has power, he holds the safety of the city for ransom.  He wants money and a ""Nixon-like"" pardon.  But his arrogant cockiness loses him his girl (she had felt sorry for him but now could see how mean he really is).
The city acquiesces to Moriarty's demands and go after the monster.  Because the bird is not in the nest when they arrive, the city is able to pull out of the deal.
In the end, Carradine manages to take care of the bird and track down the ritual killer.  Moriarty is back where he started minus one girlfriend (although Carradine tries to convince him to go back to her).
Good tight acting with Moriarty giving an amazing performance.  The stop-motion effects on the creature are a little crude at times but not really bad considering the time period and the budget.

The film itself is the greatest of all comedies by the greatest of all comedy troupes. No small intellect is behind the script, and no insignificant amount of historical knowledge either. The actors avoid playing their parts with self-knowing irony, which gives viewers the a chance to get (or miss) the humor on their own. As much fun as the film are the director's commentaries and various shorts depicting the search for castles (not as easy as it might be supposed) and the shooting of the film itself.

6301767918,,5,"A gripping portrayal of the events at Rorkes Drift, January 1879.

A small force of 1350 British soldiers was overwhelmed by 22,000 zulus at Islandwana.

The next day, an even smaller force of British troops repeatedly repelled an onslaught of 4000 zulus assaulting a missionary station converted into a field hospital. Here is their story gloriously portrayed on film! One of the greatest war-movies ever!

Against all odds, Lieutenant John Chard and Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead organized 139 British soldiers in a desperate improvised defense in the face of wave after wave of zulu tribesmen. Armed with nothing more than the standard single-shot breach-loaded Martini-Henry rifles and bayonets, this small garrison held out despite being hopelessly out-numbered and completely surrounded.

Nearly over-run on numerous occassions, under heavy fire from enemies shooting at them from the hills above, fighting at close-quarters and hand-to-hand in every engagement, ...this stubborn band of Redcoats made every shot count, and doled out plenty of punishment with cold-steel, rifle-butt, boots and bare-fists.

With such limited arms and numbers, defending such a dubious make-shift position against vast quantities of enemy fighters, it would seem inevitable that these brave British soldiers would eventually be overwhelmed like Chelford's troops at Islandwana...

This is a primary lesson in the matter of quality over quantity.
Advantages are one thing, ...but war is ultimately won in the will of the combatants...
Throughout the 19th. century British fighting-men found frequently found themsleves enormously out-numbered on the battlefield, ...but NOT out-classed!

In the aftermath of this battle, ...eleven Victoria Crosses and several other awards were earned at Rorkes Drift.

This spectacular resistance was the result of two worthy battlefield-leaders collaborating to lead a number of disciplined, well-trained professional fighting-men who were determined to make a good showing of themselves, despite what seemed to be an inevitable violent death.

6301972732,,5,"Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery star in one of the earliest great ""talkies"" entitled Min & Bill. Min (Marie Dressler) runs a waterfront hotel and saloon and she has a special although platonic bond with one of the people who rent a room there, the good natured but not very smart drunkard Bill (Wallace Beery).

The plot begins when we see that for many years Min has taken care of Nancy (Dorothy Jordan), a young girl who was essentially left on Min's doorstep when she was just a baby. Min cares deeply for Nancy and Bill too; despite her rough exterior Min has a heart of gold and good common sense. Unfortunately, trouble starts when the truant officer threatens to close down Min's hotel unless Min allows Nancy to go to school; and Min must agree to cooperate with the truant officer.

Eventually quite a few plot twists happen--I didn't find this movie slow despite what anybody else thought. Eventually Min sends Nancy to a fancy girl's school and Bill and Min continue to live their lives even though Min privately misses Nancy desperately.

Things get really rough when both Nancy and Nancy's mother Bella Pringle (Marjorie Rambeau) come back to Min's saloon and hotel for their own reasons. Will Bill and Min be able to keep the irresponsible Bella from finding out that Nancy is her real daughter? How would Nancy handle things if she knew that Bella was her mother? What happens between Min and Bella after Bella insists on sticking around and mooching off her daughter Nancy? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll have to watch the movie to fine out these answers.

The choreography didn't impress me very much; the scenes don't have any fancy footwork in them and I suspect that this could be because many of the cameras they used at the time could be difficult to move. The cinematography reflects good judgment in scenes including the speeding, out of control boat ride with Min and Nancy in the boat as well as the beautiful pictures of the bay where Min's hotel is located.

Overall, Min & Bill provides great entertainment. The plot moved along at a good pace and it held my attention rather well. Marie Dressler gives a stunning performance as Min; and Wallace Beery as Bill is every bit as good. I highly recommend this film for fans of early ""talkie"" movies that truly remain classic movies to this day.","09 7, 2007",A2R6RA8FRBS608,Matthew G.

Myra Hassman is a young pianist in Philadelphia who's taken on as a protege of Maestro Goronoff. She falls in love with him, but he becomes jealous when she outshines him during their performance of Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. After Goronoff severs their relationship, she marries her childhood friend, George, who is well aware of her love for the Maestro.

The film has a peculiar quality to it with pastel colors out of a storybook. Much of it feels like a dream, which is how Myra Hassman perceives Goronoff and his bohemian artist's lifestyle. He jets off to Paris, Prague, London, and South America whenever he wants. He lives in palaces and appears to be Prince Charming to countless Cinderellas. He poses, seduces, and moves on. None of it is real. The only thing that is important to him is music.

All the musical sequences were wonderful, especially the musical performance in Carnegie Hall where their relationship played out simultaneously. I also loved Grandmother Goronoff (Maria Ouspenskaya) who brings wisdom and humor to the story and almost steals the film.

We're given a happy ending where Myra chooses to leave the stage and embrace her loyal husband, George. It's true that she's built a life with George and her now-grown daughter, Porgy, for 20 years. However, I wasn't convinced. I still felt a distance between George and Myra and could easily see Myra choosing to live with the Maestro, who appears to have learned his lesson through time and experience.","02 16, 2016",A235IF7V4XS5HB,Zoo,{'Format:': ' DVD'},Musical Film That Reaches Sublime Moments,1455580800,False,,Movies_and_TV

They were supposed to be ravanous flesh hungry zombies but that wasn't what you see. For instance take the bloke who gets pinned down in the lift. You see loads of zombies clawing at him but when he becomes a zombie later, he has some lacerations and a few chunks out of him. Does that seem like ravanous zombies to you? If that had been a george romero film, you can guarantee that there wouldn't have been anything left of him to get back up. Except maybe a skeleton. Where as Resident Evil Apocalypse was better than i thought it would be. The blood flowed much more in this film. The zombies took more detailed chunks out of their victims (if you were pinned down in this film, there would be nothing left of you as these zombies really are hungry. Check out the poor woman who gets it in the school. You don't see her again. Gee i wonder why?) and the lickers were better too and it was scary during parts too. The intro to jill was cool.

6301965639,,3,"Best Foot Forward is a pleasant diversion to watch even still today. It was originally a successful Broadway play which MGM got the rights to and filmed in colour.
The movie was definitely aimed at a teenage audience to inspire them to get into the military swing of things,you might say. It concerns three young cadet sergeants and their girls. There is an up coming prom with the neighbouring girls school but one of the sergeants has written to Lucille Ball who has unexpectedly accepted his invitation to attend the prom with him. Now he has the task of trying to keep his girl from finding out AND attending the prom. To top things off Lucille Ball,due to academy rules,can only go with him under his girlfriends' name! And she's only there at her managers' insistence,to get publicity! His girlfriend eventually finds out,and boy falls out with girl,mayhem ensues but alls well that ends well.
The plot is nothing special and the script could/should have been much better. Instead alot of the lines are plain,trite and miss the mark much too often. Lucille Ball unfortunately gives her best but just isn't given enough of signifigance to say or do.
However there are two elements that save the movie. The first is Nancy Walker who does a terrific turn as a smart alecky debutante. She provides the film with the majority of its' laughs.
The second is Harry James. I have always considered him to be the greatest trumpet player of the 20th century and this movie provides more than ample proof,and all within two numbers. The first is ""Two O'Clock Jump"",one of his big hits and a real great jump tune. The second is ""Flight of the Bumblebee"".There are no adjectives that I could use to adequately describe the fingerwork and technique on this number. It was astonishing to watch in /43 and is STILL a wonder to this day. He even does a duet dance number with Nancy Walker. And all this in colour!
And speaking of colour. This print generally is very good. There are a couple of short cut scenes that appear a little out of focus but other than that it looks like it was filmed yesterday.
To recap; Best Foot Forward while ""OSCAR caliber"" is NOT one of its' attributes,and while it is a film very much of its' time,it is still a very plesant diversion. It is in crisp colour and Lucille Ball fans will find a nice spot for it in their library I'm sure. Also to watch out for is a young Gloria De Haven and June Allyson. Nancy Walker is the comic standout and Harry James rounds things out beautifully in the music department with his peerless horn playing.
I might also add that the soundtrack is still available,but not for long. It is made by Rhino records in a very limited addition CD.Only 2500 copies have been pressed in all so may I suggest if you like the numbers in this movie you will love the CD also.","09 28, 2007",A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,Robert Badgley,{'Format:': ' DVD'},A nice trip back to the musical 40s,1190937600,False,,Movies_and_TV

The tragic love affair (and its consequences) between the noted theologian Peter Abelard and the brilliant Heloise is artfully brought to the screen in the adaptation of the novel by the same name.  The casting and cinematograhy were supurb.

Two versions of this film exist on videotape.  The unrated version is by far the best, although EXTREMELY graphic.  The ""R"" rated version toned the explicit material down significantly -- but also cut much material which had nothing to do with any ""racy"" scenes, and really did damage to the plot line.

As an additional ""plus"", some of the historical liberties which the author of the novel took (see my review for details) were greatly toned down in the film.

1573306932,,5,"As is true of some, or many, of the previous Amazon reviewers of this film, if  you expected it to be focused on the music being played, as he did in his films on the Who, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan (the last named at Newport), you will quite justifiably be disappointed. This is a story of an event, the gathering of 600,000, mostly young people, on an island off the coast of England, to attend a Rock Concert. It is not a filming of a Rock Concert. To my perception, there is minimal attention to that aspect of the Happening, save as it  showed something about the totality of the event. That may not be to your liking, it may be a weaker film than if it had taken the focus many potential viewers prefer, but, there you are. He made the film he set out to make (whatever may be the unexplained reasons for doing so) and forbore making the film that  he has shown  he can create with excellence.
While I, too, expected a film similar to the one on Dylan, which I saw recently, the real purpose became evident within a short time after the scene setting opening. For me the shift in direction of my attention did not frustrate me, since it gave me a chance to see what his raw materials allowed him to show about crowd events, differences in reactions among performers,and differences between performers and management. Unfortunately. he was limited by the obvious fact that it is not possible to add footage after 20 years lag (the period in which the raw film was simmering before Lerner was able to get a commission to do the job). What he had on hand was what he had to work with(and, happily, he did not interview participants twenty years after the fact which can often be an exercise in collecting distorted memories). How good is the end product. Quite good for a television special, quite inadequate for an in-depth study of interesting hypotheses which emerge from what is shown in the film. I give it an above average rating because it should be of considerable interest to viewers who have read and seen interviews and remembrances of the events, without having a chance to see any part of these events themselves.
If you want to see the largest event of its kind in Rock history, Isle of Wright had fifty percent more people than Woodstock, this is probably the best (non-fiction) film you are going to see on the subject. If you expect in-depth analysis, you will have to search the academic literature (as I have not). If, as I said before, you want an appreciable view of the music being played and sung. you will not find it here. ( I should note that this sort of gathering and psychic/emotional motivation and response, is hardly unique in history, there have been periods in American, as well as European (and other culture's)  histories, in which they were commonplace and far more intense. However, there was no motion picture camera turned on participants in these events in the 1840's, as there were on the Isle of Wight in 1970.","12 31, 2009",A2VJ80PM1G00QV,drkhimxz,{'Format:': ' DVD'},A TOUGH ONE FOR MURRAY LERNER,1262217600,True,,Movies_and_TV

6300166651,,5,"Ah, ""The Monster Club"".  This crazy little masterpiece is one of my all-time favorite movies.  A sort of combination horror anthology/variety show, we're treated to three unusual short stories (all of them good, but very different in tone from one another), each one sandwiched between a musical number by a long-forgotten, early Eighties British New Wave band.

When a gentlemanly vampire by the name of Eramus (the one and only Vincent Price) doesn't realize that the man he just attacked was in fact his favorite writer (John Carradine), he attempts to amend the situation by bringing him as his special guest to a nightclub where no humans -- only monsters -- are allowed.  During the course of his evening there, Carradine is told a trio of frightening tales, and this (together with the music and dancing) provides the basic idea behind the film (I have no idea how closely this movie resembles the book on which it was apparently based).  Of the stories, I liked the third one best, for all its great atmosphere (a dreary village where everything is blue and gray and shrouded in never-lifting fog), unsettling thoughts and occurrences (I shudder every time the girl says the words, ""good eating""), and fantastic artwork (the black-and-white still images we see as we learn the village's back-story, which are just gorgeous).  Nevertheless, the first two stories are enjoyable too ... while the first is so sad and sweet and stylishly put together, the lighthearted second (which stars Donald Pleasance, for fans of ""Halloween"") makes an attempt at a more humorous storytelling style.

But what really makes me smile with ""TMC"" are the linking pieces of narration, set in the nightclub ... in an anthology film such as this, the framework tends more often, I've found to be the weakest part fo the movie ... but not here.  WE're treated with some great music (my favorite has to be vampire singer B.A. Robertson's ""I'm Just a Sucker for Your Love"", mainly for the song's goofy bounce, terrible pun-filled lyrics, the wacky way the camera the single camera used to film the performance moves while Mr. Robertson does his thing), and the overall enthusiastic silliness of the whole sequence.  But I really should say that I enjoyed all four of the songs we get to hear, and that I often put the disc in just to view the performances and enjoy the music.

But really, Price is the true star of the movie, clearly enjoying every second he's allowed to spend before the camera.  From his first meeting with Carradine to his explanation of monster genealogy to his lecture on why humans are truly the greatest monsters of all,, Price really makes TMC his own from start to finish and is definitely the best thing about the whole film.  If there's any reason to see this movie at all, it's to watch the man at work.  Price is (was) one of my very favorite actors, and in this film he certainly doesn't disappoint.  Plus, we get to see him boogie down with a monster on the dance floor as the final musical number plays ... and who could refuse a chance to see that?

The folks at Pathfinder have released TMC in an edition that  include a number of special features (mostly in the form of highly interesting reading material), the complete soundtrack of the film (for my money the best special feature of all, as these are the original soundtrack album versions, and not the live ones we hear in the movie), and really quite a bit more.  There's an Easter Egg too, on the special features menu, if you can find it.  I must say that I would have loved to have heard director Roy Ward Baker on the commentary track, but the one included hear, by a pair of Generation X movie critics, is an entertaining listen even without him.

I will conclude by saying that with a goofy, fun and yet still-creepy horror film full of great music and memorable performances, together with enough bonus material to keep you busy for quite a while after the movie's over, ""The Monster Club"" is a movie you just shouldn't turn down if a copy manages to come your way.  So before October 31 rolls around grab a copy for yourself, and make it a double feature with 1970's ""The House that Dripped Blood"", a classic horror anthology from the golden age of the genre.  Then turn out the lights, pop some popcorn, and get ready to have some fun.

6301914090,,3,"I've lived in the south since I was 9 years old and noticed immediately upon moving here that the locals have a fanatical love of NASCAR. I never really did connect with the sport though. But this is the south, and most folks here make it a point to watch NASCAR often. I remember watching Days of Thunder when it first came out on VHS and remember thinking that it was impressive on a Surround Sound setup, but I honestly didn't remember that much else about it, and that's largely because there's not much to it.

The movie, in a nutshell, chronicles the rise of up and coming rookie driver Cole Trickle, played by Tom Cruise. Cole just got bumped from his previous racing job due to some fiasco involving his father, and wants to eventually work his way up to Indy racing, and uses stock car racing as the best path to that goal. He enlists the help of Robert Duvall, a legendary crew chief who recently retired, to garner enough wins to proceed with his ultimate plans. The movie is something of a retread (pun intended) of Top Gun, as others have noted, in that the main character is a cocky, headstrong pilot of a vehicle who has a rivalry with a fellow pilot/driver (Michael Rooker in this case, Iceman in ""Top Gun""), suffers an accident (a big crash in this film, F-14 crash in ""Top Gun""), goes through a long period of doubt, but comes out on top in the end. And that's before you even get to the Kelly McGillis/Nicole Kidman parallels. Essentially this is a very formulaic movie plot in which the names and vehicles are changed around a bit but not much else. Thankfully they omitted the obligatory beach volleyball scene with Cole Trickle spiking Russ Wheeler in his big smug face.

The acting is pretty ho-hum. Cruise plays a straight out of the archtype handbook rendition of the youthful, brash, hot shot while Duvall covers the older, more sagely guiding force. I really like Robert Duvall and I think he stood head and shoulders above the others acting-wise. He brings a great deal of realism to the characters he portrays on screen and he nails this part perfectly to the point where you'd swear his character actually did build stock cars and manage pit crews for a living.

One of the most annoying aspects of the film are the names it gives to various drivers...""Cole Trickle"", ""Russ Wheeler"", and ""Rowdy Burns"", as prime examples. You can almost see the producers sitting around a conference table and trying to decide on a name that encompassed the evocative image of the typical Southern standout racecar driver. One can easily think of additional names they could have used that fit this formula: Hoss Firewall, Jackson Ridge, Jet Burleson, etc. There's the inclusion of real NASCAR drivers in the movie like ""King"" Richard Petty and others to help introduce realism into the movie, and here it somewhat succeeds. The races look real and one can imagine the rush it must be to hold vehicles together that are largely ginormous engines strapped to four wheels with a steering wheel attached while moving at 200+ miles per hour.

""Days of Thunder"" is basically a very mediocre movie with adequate acting and above average racing action. But it is just about the only modern Hollywood feature where you can take a glimpse into the fast paced life of the typical NASCAR driver. And for this reason you'll find it on a lot of NASCAR fans' DVD shelves. If you're interested in stock car racing (and a pre-botox Nicole Kidman) you'll likely enjoy the film.","10 25, 2008",A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,Ethan D Van Vorst,{'Format:': ' DVD'},A movie filled with nothing but left turns,1224892800,False,,Movies_and_TV
